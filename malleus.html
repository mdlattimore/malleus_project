<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum (1486)</h1></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><h3>translated by Montague Summers [1928]</h3></div>
<p>This is the best known (i.e., the most infamous) of the witch-hunt manuals. Written in Latin, the Malleus was first submitted to the University of Cologne on May 9th, 1487. The title is translated as "The Hammer of Witches". Written by James Sprenger and Henry Kramer (of which little is known), the Malleus remained in use for three hundred years. It had tremendous influence in the witch trials in England and on the continent. This translation is in the public domain.</p><p>The Malleus was used as a judicial case-book for the detection and persecution of witches, specifying rules of evidence and the canonical procedures by which suspected witches were tortured and put to death.  Thousands of people (primarily women) were judically murdered as a result of the procedures described in this book, for no reason than a strange birthmark, living alone, mental illness, cultivation of medicinal herbs, or simply because they were falsely accused (often for financial gain by the accuser). The Malleus serves as a horrible warning about what happens when intolerence takes over a society.</p><p>Although the Malleus is manifestly a document which displays the cruelty, barbarism, and ignorance of the Inquisition, it has also been interpreted as evidence of a wide-spread subterranean pagan tradition which worshiped a pre-Christian horned deity, particularly by <a href="../murray.htm">Margaret Murray</a>.</p>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It has been recognized even from the very earliest times, during the first
 gropings towards the essential conveniences of social decency and social
 order, that witchcraft is an evil thing, an enemy to light, an ally of the
 powers of darkness, disruption, and decay. Sometimes, no doubt, primitive
 communities were obliged to tolerate the witch and her works owing to fear;
 in other words, witchcraft was a kind of blackmail; but directly Cities were
 able to to co-ordinate, and it became possible for Society to protect itself,
 precautions were taken and safeguards were instituted against this curse,
 this bane whose object seemed to blight all that was fair, all that was just
 and good, and that was well-appointed and honourable, in a word, whose aim
 proved to be set up on high the red standard of revolution; to overwhelm
 religion, existing order, and the comeliness of life in an abyss of anarchy,
 nihilism, and despair. In his great treatise <i>De Ciutate Dei</i> S.
 Augustine set forth the theory, or rather the living fact, of the two Cities,
 the City of God, and the opposing stronghold of all that is not for God,
 that is to say, of all that is against Him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This seems to be a natural truth which the inspired Doctor has so eloquently
 demonstrated in his mighty pages, and even before the era of Christianity
 men recognized the verity, and nations who had never heard the Divine
 command put into practice the obligation of the Mosaic maxim: Thou shalt
 not suffer a witch to live. (Vulgate: Maleficos non patieris uiuere. Douay:
 Wizards thou shalt not suffer to live. <i>Exodus</i>, xxii, 18.)<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is true that both in the Greek and in the earlier Roman cults, worships
 often directly derived from secret and sombre sources, ancient gods, or
 rather demons, had their awful superstitions and their horrid rites, powers
 whom men dreaded but out of very terror placated; fanes men loathed but
 within whose shadowed portals they bent and bowed the knee perforce in
 trembling fear. Such deities were the Thracian Bendis, whose manifestation
 was heralded by the howling of her fierce black hounds, and Hecate the
 terrible “QUeen of the realm of ghosts,” as Euripides calls her,
 and the vampire Mormo and the dark Summanus who at midnight hurled loud
 thunderbolts and launched the deadly levin through the starless sky. Pliny
 tells us that the worship of this mysterious deity lasted long, and dogs
 with their puppies were sacrificed to him with atrocious cruelty, but S.
 Augustine says that in his day “one could scarce find one within a
 while, that had heard, nay more, that had read so much as the name of
 Summanus” (<i>De Ciuitate Dei</i>, iv, 23). Nevertheless there is only
 too much reason to believe that this devil-god had his votaries, although
 his liturgy was driven underground and his supplicants were obliged to
 assemble in remote and secret places. Towards the end of the fifth century,
 the Carthaginian Martianus Capella boldly declares that Summanus is none
 other than the lord of Hell, and he was writing, it may be remembered, only
 a few years before the birth of S. Benedict;
 some think that he was still alive when the Father of All Monks was born.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Although in Greek States the prosecution of witches was rare, in large
 measure owing to the dread they inspired, yet cases were not unknown, for
 Theoris, a woman of Lemnos, who is denounced by Demosthenes, was publicly
 tried at Athens and burned for her necromancy. It is perhaps not impertinent
 to observe that many strange legends attached to the island of Lemnos, which
 is situated in the Aegaean Sea, nearly midway between Mt. Athos and the
 Hellespoint. It is one of the largest of the group, having an area of some
 147 square miles. Lemnos was sacred to Hephaestus, who is said to have fallen
 here when hurled by Zeus from Olympus. The
 workshops of the Smith-God in ancient legend were supposed to be on the
 island, although recent geologists deny that this area was ever volcanic,
 and the fires which are spoken of as issuing from it must be considered
 gaseous. Later the <i>officinae</i> of Hephaestus were placed in
 Sicily and the Lipari Islands, particularly
 Hiera.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The worship of Hephaestus in later days seems to have degenerated and to
 have been identified with some of the secret cults of the evil powers. This
 was probably due to his connexion with fire and also to his extreme ugliness,
 for he was frequently represented as a swarthy man of grim and forbidding
 aspect. It should further be noted that the old Italian deity Volcanus, with
 whom he was to be identified, is the god of destructive fire - fire
 considered in its rage and terror, as contrasted with fire which is a comfort
 to the human race, the kindly blaze on the hearth, domestic fire, presided
 over by the gracious lady Vesta. It is impossible not to think of the fall
 of Lucifer when one considers the legend of Hephaestus. Our Lord replied,
 when the disciples reported: Domine, etiam
 daemonia subiiciuntur nobis in nomine tuo (Lord, the devils also are
 subject to us in Thy Name), Uidebam Satanam sicut fulgur de coelo cadentem
 (I saw Satan like lightning falling from Heaven); and
 Isaias says: “Quomodo cecidisti de
 coelo, Lucifer, qui mane oriebaris? Corruisti in terram qui uulnerabas
 gentes?” (How art thou fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, who didst rise
 in the morning? How art thou fallen to the earth, that didst wound the
 nations?) Milton also has the following poetic
 allusion:<p>
<ul>

 Nor was his name unheard or unador'd<br/>
 In Ancient <i>Greece;</i> and in <i>Ausonian</i> land<br/>
 Men called him <i>Mulciber;</i> and how he fell<br/>
 From Heav'n, they fabl'd, thrown by angry <i>Jove</i><br/>
 Sheer o'er the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn<br/>
 To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,<br/>
 A Summers day; and with the setting Sun<br/>
 Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,<br/>
 On <i>Lemnos</i> th' <i>Ægæan</i> Ile: thus they relate,<br/>
 Erring; for he with his rebellious rout<br/>
 Fell long before; nor aught avail'd him now<br/>
 To have built in Heav'n high Towrs; nor did he scape<br/>
 By all his Engins, but was headlong sent<br/>
 With his industrious crew to build in hell.

 </ul><ul></ul><p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Accordingly, during the years 319-21 a number of laws were passed which
 penalized and punished the craft of magic with the utmost severity. A pagan
 diviner or haruspex could only follow his vocation under very definite
 restrictions. He was not allowed to be an intimate visitor at the house of
 any citizen, for friendship with men of this kind must be avoided. “The
 haruspex who frequents the houses of others shall die at the stake,”
 such is the tenor of the code. It is hardly
 an exaggeration to say that almost every year saw a more rigid application
 of the laws; although even as to-day, when fortune-telling and peering into
 the future are forbidden by the Statute-Book, diviners and mediums abound,
 so then in spite of every prohibition astrologers, clairvoyants, and
 palmists had an enormous <i>clientèle</i> of rich and poor alike.
 However, under Valens, owing to his discovery of the damning fact that
 certain prominent courtiers had endeavoured by means ot table-rapping to
 ascertain who should be his successor upon the throne, in the year 367 a
 regular crusade, which in its details recalls the heyday of Master Matthew
 Hopkins, was instituted against the whole race of magicians, soothsayers,
 mathematici, and theurgists, which perhaps was the first general prosecution
 during the Christian era. Large numbers of persons, including no doubt many
 innocent as well as guilty, were put to death, and a veritable panic swept
 through the Eastern world.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The early legal codes of most European nations contain laws directed against
 witchcraft. Thus, for example, the oldest document of Frankish legislation,
 the Salic Law (<i>Lex salica</i>), which was reduced to a written form and
 promulgated under Clovis, who died 27 November, 511, mulcts (sic) those who
 practise magic with various fines, especially when it could be proven that
 the accused launched a deadly curse, or had tied the Witch's Knot. This
 latter charm was usually a long cord tightly tied up in elaborate loops,
 among whose reticulations it was customary to insert the feathers of a black
 hen, a raven, or some other bird which had, or was presumed to have, no
 speck of white. This is one of the oldest instruments of witchcraft and is
 known in all countries and among all nations. It was put to various uses.
 The wizards of Finland, when they sold wind in the three knots of a rope.
 If the first knot were undone a gentle breeze sprang up; if the second, it
 blew a mackerel gale; if the third, a hurricane.
 But the Witch's Ladder, as it was often known, could be used with far more
 baleful effects. The knots were tied with certain horrid maledictions, and
 then the cord was hidden away in some secret place, and unless it were
 found and the strands released the person at whom the curse was directed
 would pine and die. This charm continually occurs during the trials. Thus
 in the celebrated Island-Magee case, March 1711, when a coven of witches was
 discovered, it was remarked that an apron belonging to Mary Dunbar, a visitor
 at the house of the afflicted persons, had been abstracted. Miss Dunbar was
 suddenly seized with fits and convulsions, and sickened almost to death.
 After most diligent search the missing garment was found carefully hidden
 away and covered over, and a curious string which had nine knots in it had
 been so tied up with the folds of the linen that it was beyond anything
 difficult to separate them and loosen the ligatures. In 1886 in the old
 belfry of a village church in England there were accidentally discovered,
 pushed away in a dark corner, several yards of incle braided with elaborate
 care and having a number of black feathers thrust through the strands. It is
 said that for a long while considerable wonder was caused as to what it
 might be, but when it was exhibited and became known, one of the local
 grandmothers recognized it was a Witch's Ladder, and, what is extremely
 significant, when it was engraved in the <i>Folk Lore Journal</i> an old
 Italian woman to whom the picture was shown immediately identified it as
 <i>la ghirlanda delle streghe</i>.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The laws of the Visigoths, which were to some extent founded upon the Roman
 law, punished witches who had killed any person by their spells with death;
 whilst long-continued and obstinate witchcraft, if fully proven, was visited
 with such severe sentences as slavery for life. In 578, when a son of Queen
 Fredegonde died, a number of witches who were accused of having contrived
 the destruction of the Prince were executed. It has been said in these
 matters that the ecclesiastical law was tolerant, since for the most part it
 contented itself with a sentence of excommunication. But those who consider
 this spiritual outlawry lenient certainly do not appreciate what such a doom
 entailed. Moreover, after a man had been condemned to death by the civil
 courts it would have been somewhat superfluous to have repeated the same
 sentence, and beyond the exercise of her spiritual weapons, what else was
 there left for the Church to do?<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In 814, Louis le Pieux upon his accession to the throne began to take very
 active measures against all sorcerers and necromancers, and it was owing to
 his influence and authority that the Council of Paris in 829 appealed to the
 secular courts to carry out any such sentences as the Bishops might
 pronounce. The consequence was that from this time forward the penalty of
 witchcraft was death, and there is evidence that if the constituted authority,
 either ecclesiastical or civil, seemed to slacken in their efforts the
 populace took the law into their own hands with far more fearful results.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In England the early Penitentials are greatly concerned with the repression
 of pagan ceremonies, which under the cover of Christian festivities were
 very largely practised at Christmas and on New Year's Day. These rites were
 closely connected with witchcraft, and especially do S. Theodore, S. Aldhelm,
 Ecgberht of York, and other prelates prohibit the masquerade as a horned
 animal, a stag, or a bull, which S. Caesarius of Arles had denounced as a
 “foul tradition,” an “evil custom,” a “most
 heinous abomination.” These and even stronger expressions would not be
 used unless some very dark and guilty secrets had been concealed beneath
 this mumming, which, however foolish, might perhaps have been thought to be
 nothing worse, so that to be so roundly denounced as devilish and demoniacal
 they must certainly have had some very grim signification which did not
 appear upon the surface. The laws of King Athelstan (924-40), corresponsive
 with the early French laws, punished any person casting a spell which
 resulted in death by extracting the extreme penalty. During the eleventh
 and twelfth centuries there are few cases of witchcraft in England, and such
 accusations as were made appeared to have been brought before the
 ecclesiastical court. It may be remarked, however, that among the laws
 attributed to King Kenneth I of Scotland, who ruled from 844 to 860, and
 under whom the Scots of Dalriada and the Pictish peoples may be said to have
 been united in one kingdom, is an important statute which enacts that all
 sorcerers and witches, and such as invoke spirits, “and use to seek
 upon them for helpe, let them be burned to death.” Even then this was
 obviously no new penalty, but the statutory confirmation of a long-established
 punishment. So the witches of Forres who attempted the life of King Duffus
 in the year 968 by the old bane of slowly melting a wax image, when discovered,
 were according to the law burned at the stake.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The conversion of Germany to Christianity was late and very slow, for as
 late as the eighth century, in spite of the heroic efforts of S. Columbanus,
 S. Fridolin, S. Gall, S. Rupert, S. Willibrod, the great S. Boniface, and
 many others, in spite of the headway that had been made, various districts
 were always relapsing into a primitive and savage heathenism. For example,
 it is probably true to say that the Prussian tribles were not stable in
 their conversion until the beginning of the thirteenth century, when Bishop
 Albrecht reclaimed the people by a crusade. However, throughout the eleventh
 and the twelfth centuries there are continual instances of persons who had
 practised witchcraft being put to death, and the Emperor Frederick II, in
 spite of the fact that he was continually quarrelling with the Papacy and
 utterly indifferent to any religious obligation - indeed it has been said
 that he was “a Christian ruler only in name,” and “throughout
 his reign he remained virtually a Moslem free-thinker” - declared that
 a law which he had enacted for Lombardy should have force throughout the
 whole of his dominions. “Henceforth,” Vacandard remarks,
 “all uncertainty was at an end. The legal punishment for heresy
 throughout the empire was death at the stake.” It must be borne in
 mind that witchcraft and heresy were almost inextricably commingled. It is
 quite plain that such a man as Frederick, whose whole philosophy was entirely
 Oriental; who was always accompanied by a retinue of Arabian ministers,
 courtiers, and officers; who was perhaps not without reason suspected of
 being a complete agnostic, recked little whether heresy and witchcraft might
 be offences against the Church or not, but he was sufficiently shrewd to see
 that they gravely threatened the well-being of the State, imperilling the
 maintenance of civilization and the foundations of society.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This brief summary of early laws and ancient ordinances has been given in
 order to show that the punishment of witchcraft certainly did not originate
 in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, and most assuredly was not
 primarily the concern of the Inquisition. In fact, curiously enough, Bernard
 Gui, the famous Inquisitor of Toulouse, laid down in his
 <i>Practica Inquisitionis</i> that sorcery
 itself did not fall within the cognizance of the Holy Office, and in every
 case, unless there were other circumstances of which his tribunal was bound
 to take notice when witches came before him, he simply passed them on to the
 episcopal courts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It may be well here very briefly to consider the somewhat complicated history
 of the establishment of the Inquisition, which was, it must be remembered,
 the result of the tendencies and growth of many years, by no mens a judicial
 curia with cut-and-dried laws and a compete procedure suddenly called into
 being by one stroke of a Papal pen. In the first place, S. Dominic was in
 no sense the founder of the Inquisition. Certainly during the crusade in
 Languedoc he was present, reviving religion and reconciling the lapsed, but
 he was doing no more than S. Paul or any of the Apostles would have done.
 The work of S. Dominic was preaching and the organization of his new Order,
 which received Papal confirmation from Honorius III, and was approved in the
 Bull <i>Religiosam uitam</i>, 22 December, 1216. S. Dominic died 6 August,
 1221, and even if we take the word in a very broad sense, the first Dominican
 Inquisitor seems to have been Alberic, who in November, 1232, was travelling
 through Lombardy with the official title of “Inquisitor hereticae
 prauitatis.” The whole question of the episcopal Inquisitors, who were
 really the local bishop, his archdeacons, and his diocesan court, and their
 exact relationship with the travelling Inquisitors, who were mainly drawn
 from the two Orders of friars, the Franciscan and the Dominican, is extremely
 nice and complicated; whilst the gradual effacement of the episcopal courts
 with regard to certain matters and the consequent prominence of the Holy
 Office were circumstances and conditions which realized themselves slowly
 enough in all countries, and almost imperceptibly in some districts, as
 necessity required, without any sudden break or sweeping changes. In fact we
 find that the Franciscan or Dominican Inquisitor simply sat as an assessor
 in the episcopal court so that he could be consulted upon certain
 technicalities and deliver sentence conjointly with the Bishop if these
 matters were involved. Thus at the trial of Gilles de Rais in October, 1440,
 at Nantes, the Bishop of Nantes presided over the court with the bishops of
 Le Mans, Saint-Brieuc, and Saint-Lo as his coadjutors, whilst Pierre de
 l’Hospital, Chencellor of Brittany, watched the case on behalf of the
 civil authorities, and Frère Jean Blouin was present as the delegate
 of the Holy Inquisition for the city and district of Nantes. Owing to the
 multiplicity of the crimes, which were proven and clearly confessed in
 accordance with legal requirements, it was necessary to pronounce two
 sentences. The first sentence was passed by the Bishop of Nantes conjointly
 with the Inquisitor. By them Gilles de Rais was declared guilty of Satanism,
 sorcery, and apostasy, and there and then handed over to the civil arm to
 receive the punishment due to such offences. The second sentence, pronounced
 by the Bishop alone, declared the prisoner convicted of sodomy, sacrilege,
 and violation of ecclesiastical rights. The ban of excommunication was
 lifted since the accused had made a clean breast of his crimes and desired
 to be reconciled, but he was handed over to the secular court, who sentenced
 him to death, on multiplied charges of murder as well as on account of the
 aforesaid offences.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It must be continually borne in mind also, and this is a fact which is very
 often slurred over and forgotten, that the heresies of the twelfth and
 thirteenth centuries, to cope with which the tribunal of the Inquisition
 was primarily organized and regularized, were by no means mere theoretical
 speculations, which, however erroneous and dangerous in the fields of
 thought, practically and in action would have been arid and utterly
 unfruitful. To-day the word “heresy” seems to be as obsolete
 and as redolent of a Wardour-street vocabulary as if one were to talk of a
 game of cards at Crimp or Incertain, and to any save a dusty mediaevalist
 it would appear to be an antiquarian term. It was far other in the twelfth
 century; the wild fanatics who fostered the most subversive and abominable
 ideas aimed to put these into actual practice, to establish communities and
 to remodel whole territories according to the programme which they had so
 carefully considered in every detail with a view to obtaining and enforcing
 their own ends and their own interests. The heretics were just as resolute
 and just as practical, that is to say, just as determined to bring about the
 domination of their absolutism as is any revolutionary of to-day. The aim
 and objects of their leaders, Tanchelin, Everwacher, the Jew Manasses, Peter
 Waldo, Pierre Autier, Peter of Bruys, Arnold of Brescia, and the rest, were
 exactly those of Lenin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, and their fellows. There were,
 of course, minor differences and divergences in their tenets, that is to say,
 some had sufficient cunning to conceal and even to deny the extremer views
 which other were bold enough or mad enough more openly to proclaim. But
 just below the trappings, a little way beneath the surface, their motives,
 their methods, their intentions, the goal to which they pressed, were all
 the same. Their objects may be summed up as the abolition of monarchy, the
 abolition of private property and of inheritance, the abolition of marriage,
 the abolition of order, the total abolition of all religion. It was against
 this that the Inquisition had to fight, and who can be surprised if, when
 faced with so vast a conspiracy, the methods employed by the Holy Office may
 not seem - if the terrible conditions are conveniently forgotten - a little
 drastic, a little severe? There can be no doubt that had this most excellent
 tribunal continued to enjoy its full prerogative and the full exercise of
 its salutary powers, the world at large would be in a far happier and far
 more orderly position to-day. Historians may point out diversities and
 dissimilarities between the teaching of the Waldenses, the Albigenses, the
 Henricans, the Poor Men of Lyons, the Cathari, the Vaudois, the Bogomiles,
 and the Manichees, but they were in reality branches and variants of the
 same dark fraternity, just as the Third International, the Anarchists, the
 Nihilists, and the Bolsheviks are in every sense, save the mere label,
 entirely identical.

 <p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In fact heresy was one huge revolutionary body, exploiting its forces
 through a hundred different channels and having as its object chaos and
 corruption. The question may be asked - What was their ultimate aim in
 wishing to destroy civilization? What did they hope to gain by it? Precisely
 the same queries have been put and are put to-day with regard to these
 political parties. There is an apparent absence of motive in this seemingly
 aimless campaign of destruction to extermination carried on by the Bolsheviks
 in Russia, which has led many people to inquire what the objective can
 possibly be. So unbridled are the passions, so general the demolition, so
 terrible the havoc, that hard-headed individuals argue that so complete a
 chaos and such revolting outrages could only be affected by persons who were
 enthusiasts in their own cause and who had some very definite aims thus
 positively to pursue. The energizing forces of this fanaticism, this fervent
 zeal, do not seem to be any more apparent than the end, hence more than one
 person has hesitated to accept accounts so alarming of massacres and
 carnage, or wholesale imprisonments, tortures, and persecutions, and has
 begun to suspect that the situation may be grossly exaggerated in the
 overcharged reports of enemies and the highly-coloured gossip of scare-mongers.
 Nay, more, partisans have visited the country and returned with glowing
 tales of a new Utopia. It cannot be denied that all this is a very clever
 game. It is generally accepted that from very policy neither an individual
 nor a junto or confederacy will act even occasionally, much less continually
 and consistently, in a most bloody and tyrannical way, without some very
 well-arranged programme is being thus carried out and determinate aim ensued,
 conditions and object which in the present case it seems extremely difficult
 to guess at and divine unless we are to attribute the revolution to causes
 the modern mind is apt to dismiss with impatience and intolerance.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Nearly a century and a half ago Anacharsis Clootz,
 “the personal enemy of Jesus Christ” as he openly declared
 himself, was vociferating “God is Evil,”
 “To me then Lucifer, Satan! whoever you
 may be, the demon that the faith of my fathers opposed to God and the
 Church.” This is the credo of the witch.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Although it may not be generally recognized, upon a close investigation it
 seems plain that the witches were a vast political movement, an organized
 society which was anti-social and anarchichal, a world-wide plot against
 civilization. Naturally, although the Masters were often individuals of high
 rank and deep learning, that rank and file of the society, that is to say,
 those who for the most part fell into the hands of justice, were recruited
 from the least educated classes, the ignorant and the poor. As one might
 suppose, many of the branches or covens in remoter districts knew nothing
 and perhaps could have understood nothing of the enormous system.
 Nevertheless, as small cogs in a very small wheel, it might be, they were
 carrying on the work and actively helping to spread the infection. It is an
 extremely significant fact that the last regularly official trial and
 execution for witchcraft in Western Europe was that of Anna Goeldi, who was
 hanged at Glaris in Switzerland, 17 June, 1782.
 Seven years before, in 1775, the villian Adam Weishaupt, who has been truly
 described by Louis Blac as “the profoundest conspirator that has ever
 existed,” formed his “terrible and formidable sect,” the
 Illuminati. The code of this mysterious movement lays down: “it is
 also necessary to gain the common people (das gemeine Volk) to our Order.
 The great means to that end is influence in the schools.” This is
 exactly the method of the organizations of witches, and again and again do
 writers lament and bewail the endless activities of this sect amongst the
 young people and even the children of the district. So in the prosecutions
 at Würzburg we find that there were condemned boys of ten and eleven,
 two choir boys aged twelve, “a boy of twelve years old in one of the
 lower forms of the school,” “the two young sons of the Prince's
 cook, the eldest fourteen, the younger twelve years old,” several
 pages and seminarists, as well as a number of young girls, amongst whom
 “a child of nine or ten years old and her little sister” were
 involved.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The political operations of the witches in many lands were at their trials
 exposed time after time, and these activities are often discernible even
 when they did not so publicly and prominently come to light. A very few
 cases, to which we must make but brief and inadequate reference, will stand
 for many. In England in the year 1324 no less than twenty-seven defendants
 were tried at the King's Bench for plotting against and endeavouring to kill
 Edward II, together with many prominent courtiers and officials, by the
 practice of magical arts. A number of wealthy citizens of Coventry had hired
 a famous “nigromauncer,” John of Nottingham, to slay not only
 the King, but also the royal favourite, Hugh le Despenser, and his father;
 the Prior of Coventry; the monastic steward; the manciple; and a number of
 other important personages. A secluded old manor-house, some two or three
 miles out of Coventry, was put at the disposal of Master John, and there he
 and his servant, Robert Marshall, promptly commenced business. They went to
 work in the bad old-fashioned way of modelling
 wax dolls or mommets of those whom they
 wished to destroy. Long pins were thrust through the figures, and they were
 slowly melted before a fire. The first unfortunate upon whom this experiment
 was tried, Richard de Sowe, a prominent courtier and close friend of the
 King, was suddenly taken with agonizing pains, and when Marshall visited
 the house, as if casually, in order that he might report the results of this
 sympathetic sorcery to the wizard, he found their hapless victim in a high
 delirium. When this state of things was promptly conveyed to him, Master
 John struck a pin through the heart of the image, and in the morning the
 news reached them that de Sowe had breathed his last. Marshall, who was by
 now in an extremity of terror, betook himself to a justice and laid bare all
 that was happening and had happened, with the immediate result that Master
 John and the gang of conspirators were arrested. It must be remembered that
 in 1324 the final rebellion against King Edward II had openly broken forth
 on all sides. A truce of thirteen years had been arranged with Scotland,
 and though the English might refuse Bruce his royal title he was
 henceforward the warrior king of an independent country. It is true that in
 May, 1322, the York Parliament had not only reversed the exile of the
 Despensers, declaring the pardons which had been granted their opponents
 null and void, as well as voting for the repeal of the Ordinances of 1311,
 and the Despensers were working for, and fully alive to the necessity of,
 good and stable government, but none the less the situation was something
 more than perilous; the Exchequer was well-nigh drained; there was rioting
 and bloodshed in almost every large town; and worst of all, in 1323 the
 younger Roger Mortimer had escaped from the Tower and got away safely to the
 Continent. There were French troubles to boot; Charles IV, who in 1322 had
 succeeded to the throne, would accept no excuse from Edward for any
 postponement of homage, and in this very year, 1324, declaring the English
 possessions forfeited, he proceeded to occupy the territory with an army,
 when it soon became part of the French dominion. There can be not doubt that
 the citizens of Coventry were political intriguers, and since they were at
 the moment unable openly to rebel against their sovran lord, taking
 advantage of the fact that he was harassed and pressed at so critical a
 juncture, they proceeded against him by the dark and tortuous ways of black
 magic.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Very many similar conspiracies in which sorcery was mixed up with treasonable
 practices and attempts might be cited, but only a few of the most important
 must be mentioned. Rather more than a century later than the reign of
 Edward II, in 1441, one of the greatest and most influential ladies in all
 England, “the Duchesse of Gloucestre, was arrested and put to holt,
 for she was suspecte of treson.” This, of course, was purely a
 political case, and the wife of Duke Humphrey had unfortunately by her
 indiscretion and something worse given her husband's enemies an opportunity
 to attack him by her ruin. An astrologer, attached to the Duke's household,
 when taken and charged with “werchyrye of sorcery against the King,”
 confessed that he had often cast the horoscope of the Duchess to find out if
 her husband would ever wear the English crown, the way to which they had
 attempted to smooth by making a wax image of Henry VI and melting it before
 a magic fire to bring about the King's decease. A whole crowd of witches,
 male and female, were involved in the case, and among these was Margery
 Jourdemain, a known a notorious invoker of demons and an old trafficker in
 evil charms. Eleanor Cobham was incontinently brought before a court
 presided over by three Bishops, London, Lincoln, and Norwich. She was found
 guilty both of high treason and sorcery, and after having been compelled to
 do public penance in the streets of London, she was imprisoned for life,
 according to the more authoritative account at
 Peel Castle in the Isle of Man. Her
 accomplices were executed at London.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the days of Edward IV it was commonly gossiped that the Duchess of Bedford
 was a witch, who by her spells had fascinated
 the King with the beauty of her daughter Elizabeth, whom he made his
 bride, in spite of the fact that he had plighted his troth to Eleanor Butler,
 the heiress of the Earl of Shrewsbury. So open did the scandal become that
 the Duchess of Bedford lodged an official complaint with the Privy Council,
 and an inquiry was ordered, but, as might have been suscepted, this
 completely cleared the lady. Nevertheless, five years later the charges were
 renewed by the Lord Protector, the Duke of Gloucester. Nor was this the
 first time in English history that some fair dame was said to have fascinated
 a monarch, not only by her beauty but also by unlawful means. When the
 so-called “Good Parliament” was convened in April, 1376, their
 first business seemed to be to attack the royal favourite, Alice Perrers,
 and amongst the multiplicity of charges which they brought against her, not
 the least deadly was the accusation of witchcraft. Her ascendancy over the
 King was attributed to the enchantments and experiments of a Dominican friar,
 learned in many a cantrip and cabala, whom she entertained in her house, and
 who had fashioned two pictures of Edward and Alive which, when suffumigated
 with the incense of mysterious herbs and gums, mandrakes, sweet calamus,
 caryophylleae, storax, benzoin, and other plants plucked beneath the full
 moon what time Venus was in ascendant, caused the old King to dote upon this
 lovely concubine. With great difficulty by a subtle ruse the friar was
 arrested, and he thought himself lucky to escape with relegation to a remote
 house under the strictest observance of his Order, whence, however, he was
 soon to be recalled with honour and reward, since the Good Parliament shortly
 came to an end, and Alice Perrers, who now stood higher in favour than ever,
 was not slow to heap lavish gifts upon her supporters, and to visit her
 enemies with condign punishment.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is often forgotten that in the troublous days of Henry VIII the whole
 country swarmed with astrologers and sorcerers, to whom high and low alike
 made constant resort. The King himself, a prey to the idlest superstitions,
 ever lent a credulous ear to the most foolish prophecies and old wives'
 abracadabra. When, as so speedily happened, he wearied of Anne Boleyn, he
 openly gave it as his opinion that he had “made this marriage seduced
 by witchcraft; and that this was evident because God did not permit them to
 have any male issue.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There was nobody more thoroughly scared of witchcraft than Henry's daughter,
 Elizabeth, and as John Jewel was preaching his famous sermon before her in
 February, 1560, he described at length how
 “this kind of people (I mean witches and sorcerers) within these few
 last years are marvellously increased within this Your Grace's realm;”
 he then related how owing to dark spells he had known many “pine away
 even to death.” “I pray God,” he unctuously cried, “they
 may never practise further than upon the subjects!” This was certainly
 enough to ensure that drastic laws should be passed particularly to protect
 the Queen, who was probably both thrilled and complimented to think that her
 life was in danger. It is exceedingly doubtful, whether there was any
 conspiracy at all which would have attempted Elizabeth's personal safety.
 There were, of course, during the imprisonment of the Queen of Scots, designs
 to liberate this unfortunate Princess, and Walsingham with his fellows used
 to tickle the vanity of Gloriana be regaling her with melodramatic accounts
 of dark schemes and secret machinations which they had, with a very shrewd
 knowledge of stagecraft, for the most part themselves arranged and contrived,
 so we may regard the Act of 1581, 23 Eliz., Cap. II, as mere finesse and
 chicane. That there were witches in England is very certain, but there seems
 no evidence at all that there were attempts upon the life of Elizabeth. None
 the less the point is important, since it shows that in men's minds sorcery
 was inexplicably mixed up with politics. The statute runs as follows:
 “That if any person . . . during the life of our said Sovereign Lady
 the Queen's Majesty that now is, either within her Highness' dominions or
 without, shall be setting or erecting any figure or by casting of nativities
 or by calculation or by any prophesying, witchcraft, conjurations, or other
 like unlawful means whatsoever, seek to know, and shall set forth by express
 words, deeds, or writings, how long her Majesty shall live, or who shall
 reign a king or queen of this realm of England after her Highness' decease . . .
 that then every such offence shall be felony, and every offender therein,
 and also all his aiders (etc.), shall be judged as felons and shall suffer
 pain of death and forfeit as in case of felony is used, without any benefit
 of clergy or sanctuary.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;


 <p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The famous Scotch witch trial or 1590, when it was proved that upon 31
 October in the preceding year, All Hallow E'en, a gang of more than two
 hundred persons had assembled for their rites at the old haunted church of
 North Berwick, where they consulted with their Master, “the Devil,”
 how they might most efficaciously kill King James, is too well known to
 require more than a passing mention, but it may be remembered that Agnes
 Sampson confessed that she had endeavoured to poison the King in various
 ways, and that she was also avowed that she had fashioned a wax mommet,
 saying with certain horrid maledictions as she wrought the work: “This
 is King James the sext, ordinit to be consumed at the instance of a noble
 man Francis Erle of Bodowell.” The contriver of this far-reaching
 conspiracy was indeed none other than Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell,
 who, as common knowledge bruited, almost overtly aspired to the throne and
 was perfectly reckless how he compassed his ends. It was he, no doubt, who
 figured as “the Devil” at the meeting in the deserted and
 ill-omened kirkyard. In fact this is almost conclusively shown by a statement
 of Barbara Napier when she was interrogated with regard to their objects in
 the attempted murder of the King. She gave as her reason “that another
 might have ruled in his Majesty's place, and the Government might have gone
 to the Devil.” That is to say, to Francis Bothwell. The birth of
 Prince Henry at Stirling, 19 February, 1594, and further of Prince Charles
 at Dunfermline, 19 November, 1600, must have dashed all Bothwell's hopes to
 the ground. Moreover, the vast organization of revolutionaries and witches
 had been completely broken up, and accordingly there was nothing left for
 him to do but to seek safety in some distant land. There is an extremely
 significant reference to him in Sandys, who,
 speaking of Calabria in the year 1610, writes: “Here a certaine
 <i>Calabrian</i> hearing that I was an <i>English</i> man, came to me, and
 would needs persuade me that I had insight in magicke: for the Earl
 <i>Bothel</i> was my countryman, who liues at <i>Naples</i>, and is in these
 parts famous for suspected negromancie.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In French history even more notorious than the case of the Berwick witches
 were the shocking scandals involving both poisoning and witchcraft that came
 to light and were being investigated in 1679-82. At least two hundred and
 fifty persons, of whom many were the representatives and scions of the
 highest houses in the land, were deeply implicated in these abominations,
 and it is no matter for surprise that a vast number of the reports and
 several entire dossiers and registers have completely disappeared. The
 central figures were the Abbé Guibourg and Catherine Deshayes, more
 generally known as La Voisin, whose house in the Rue Beauregard was for
 years the rendezvous of a host of inquirers drawn from all classes of
 societym from palaces and prisons, from the lowest slums of the vilest
 underworld. That it was a huge and far-reaching political conspiracy is
 patent form the fact that the lives of Louis XIV, the Queen, the Dauphin,
 Louise de la Vallière, and the Duchesse de Fontanges had been
 attempted secretly again and again, whilst as for Colbert, scores of his
 enemies were constantly entreating for some swift sure poison, constantly
 participating in unhallowed rites which might lay low the all-powerful
 Minister. It soon came to light that Madame de Montespan and the Comtesse
 de Soisson (Olympe Mancini) were both deeply implicated, whilst the
 Comtesse de Rouse and Madame de Polignac in particular, coveting a lodging
 in the bed royal, had persistently sought to bring about the death of Louise
 de la Vallière. It is curious indeed to recognize the author of <i>The
 Rehearsal</i> in this train, but there flits in and out among the witches
 and anarchists a figure who can almost certainly be identified with George
 Villiers, Duke of Buckingham. Yet this is the less surprising when we
 remember how very nearly he stirred up a mutiny, if not an insurrection,
 against the King who had so particularly favoured and honoured him, but who,
 in the words of a contemporary, “knew him to be capable of the blackest
 designs.” Of Buckingham it has been
 written without exaggeration:
 “As to his personal character it is impossible to say anything in its
 vindication; for though his severest enemies acknowledge him to have
 possessed great vivacity and a quickness of parts peculiarly adapted to the
 purposes of ridicule, yet his warmest advocates have never attributed to him
 a single virtue. His generosity was profuseness, his wit malevolence, the
 gratification of his passions his sole aim through life.” When we
 consider the alliance of Buckingham with the infamous Shaftesbury, we need
 hardly wonder that whilst in Paris he frequented the haunts of this terrible
 society, and was present at, nay, even participated in the Satanic mass and
 other of their horrible mysteries. At the house of La Voisin necromancy was
 continually practised, poisons were brewed, the liturgy of hell was
 celebrated, and it was undoubtedly the hub of every crime and ever infamy.
 Other instances, and not a few, might be quoted from French history to show
 how intimately politics were connected with witchcraft. Here Madame de
 Montespan, aiming at the French throne, an ambition which involved the death
 of the Queen, Maria Theresa of Austria, at once resorts to black magic, and
 attempts to effect her purpose by aid of those who were infamous as past
 adepts in this horrid craft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Even in the Papal States themselves such abominations were not unknown, and
 in 1633 Rome was alarmed and confounded by an attempt upon the life of Urban
 VIII. It seems that some charlatan had announced to Giacinto Centini, nephew
 of the Cardinal d’Ascoli, that his uncle would succeed the reigning
 Pontiff in the Chair of S. Peter. The rash and foolish young man promptly
 attempted to hasten the event, and did not hesitate to resort to certain
 professors of occult arts to inquire when the next conclave would take place.
 He was so incredibly foolish that, far from attempting any subterfuge or
 disguise, he seems to have resorted to the houses of astrologers and other
 persons, who were already suspected of necromancy in the most open way, and
 further to have boasted among his intimates of the high honours which he
 expected his family would shortly enjoy. He first applied to one Fra Pietro,
 a Sicilian, who belonged to the Order of Augustinian Eremites. This occultist
 told him that the Cardinal d’Ascoli would be elected at the next
 conclave, but that the present Pope had many years to live. Upon seeing the
 young man's bitter disappointment the cunning mage whispered that it was in
 his power to bring about the event much sooner than it would happen in the
 ordinary course of affairs. Needless to say, the proposition was taken up with
 alacrity, but it was necessary to employ the services of two other diviners,
 and they accordingly selected for the task Fra Cherubino of Ancona, a
 Franciscan, and Fra Domenico of the Eremite monastery of S. Agostino at
 Fermo. The friars then deligently set to work to carry out their murderous
 projects. A number of ceremonies and incantations were performed which
 entailed considerable expense, and for which it was needful to procure exotic
 herbs and drugs and rare instruments of goetry that could not readily be had
 without attracting considerable curiosity. It appeared, however, as if all
 their charms and spells, their demoniac eucharists and litanies, were quite
 ineffective, since Urban at sixty-five years of age remained perfectly hale
 and hearty and was indeed extraordinarily active in his pontificate. Young
 Centini became manifestly impatient and spurred the wizards on to greater
 efforts. It really seems as if, vexed beyond measure and goaded to
 exasperation by his importunities, they flung all caution to the winds,
 whilst he himself proclaimed so magnificently what he would do for his
 friends in a few weeks or months after he had assumed the authority of Papal
 nephew, that it was hardly a matter of surprise when the Holy Office
 suddenly descended upon the four accomplices and brought them to the bar.
 Amongst the many charges which were put forward was one of causing “a
 statue of wax to be made of Urban VIII, in order that its dissolution might
 ensure that of the Pope.” This in itself would have been sufficiently
 damning, but there were many other criminal accounts all tending to the
 same end, all proven up to the hilt. The result was that Centini, Fra Pietro,
 and Fra Cherubino were executed in the Campo di Fiore, on Sunday, 22 April,
 1634, whilst Fra Domenico, who was less desperately involved, was relegated
 for life to the galleys.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 These few instances I have dwelt upon in detail and at some length in order
 to show how constantly and continually in various countries and at various
 times witchcraft and magical practices were mixed up with political plots
 and anarchical agitation. There can be no doubt - and this is a fact which
 is so often not recognized (or it may be forgotten) that one cannot emphasize
 it too frequently - that witchcraft in its myriad aspects and myriad
 ramifications is a huge conspiracy against civilization. It was as such that
 the Inquisitors knew it, and it was this which gave rise to the extensive
 literature on the subject, those treatises of which the <i>Malleus
 Maleficarum</i> is perhaps the best known among the other writers. As early
 as 600 S. Gregory I had spoken in severest
 terms, enjoining the punishment of sorcerers and those who trafficked in
 black magic. It will be noted that he speaks of them as more often belonging
 to that class termed <i>serui</i>, that is to say, the very people from whom
 for the most part Nihilists and Bolsheviks have sprung in modern days.
 Writing to Januarius, Biship of Cagliari, the Pope says: “Contra
 idolorum cultores, uel aruspices atque sortilegos, fraternitatem uestram
 uehementius pastorali hortamur inuigilare custodia . . . et si quidem serui
 sunt, uerberibus cruciatibusque, quibus ad emendationem peruenire ualeant,
 castigare si uero sunt liberi, inclusione digna districtaque sunt in
 poenitentiam redigendi. . . .” But the first Papal ordinance directly
 dealing with witchcraft may not unfairly be said to be the Bull addressed in
 1233 by Pope Gregory IX (Ugolino, Count of
 Segni) to the famous Conrad of Marburg, bidding him proceed against the
 Luciferians, who were overtly given over to Satanism. If this ardent
 Dominican must not strictly be considered as having introduced the Inquisition
 to Germany, he at any rate enjoyed Inquisitorial methods. Generally, perhaps,
 he is best known as the stern and unbending spiritual director of that gentle
 soul S. Elizabeth of Hungary. Conrad of Marburg is certainly a type of the
 strictest and most austere judge, but it should be remembered that he spared
 himself no more than he spared others, that he was swayed by no fear of
 persons of danger of death, that even if he were inflexible and perhaps
 fanatical, the terrible situation with which he had to deal demanded such a
 man, and he was throughout supported by the supreme authority of Gregory IX.
 That he was harsh and unlovable is, perhaps, true enough, but it is more
 than doubtful whether a man of gentler disposition could have faced the
 difficulties that presented themselves on every side. Even his most
 prejudiced critics have never denied the singleness of his convictions and
 his courage. He was murdered on the highway, 30 July, 1233, in the pursuit
 of his duties, but it has been well said that “it is, perhaps,
 significant that the Church has never set the
 seal of canonization upon his martyrdom.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On 13, December, 1258, Pope Alexander IV (Rinaldo
 Conti) issued a Bull to the Franciscan Inquisitors bidding them refrain
 from judging any cases of witchcraft unless there was some very strong
 reason to suppose that heretical practice could also be amply proved. On 10
 January, 1260, the same Pontiff addressed a similar Bull to the Dominicans.
 But it is clear that by now the two things could not be disentangled.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The Bull <i>Dudum ad audientiam nostram peruenit</i> of Boniface VIII
 (Benedetto Gaetani) deals with the charges
 against Walter Langton, Bishop of Conventry
 and Lichfield, but it may be classed as individual rather than general.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Several Bulls were published by John XXII (Jacques
 d’Euse) and by Benedict XII (Jacques
 Fournier, O. Cist), both Avignon Popes, and these weighty documents
 deal with witchcraft in the fullest detail, anathematizing all such
 abominations. Gregory XI (Pierre Roger de
 Beaufort); Alexander V (Petros Filartis, a Cretan), who ruled but
 eleven months, from June 1409 to May 1410; and
 Martin V (Ottone Colonna); each put forth
 one Bull on the subject. To Eugenius IV (Gabriello
 Condulmaro) we owe four Bulls which fulminate against sorcery and black
 magic. The first of these, 24 February, 1434, is addressed from Florence to
 the Franciscan Inquisitor, Pontius Fougeyron. On 1 August, 1451, the
 Dominican Inquisitor Hugo Niger received a Bull from Nicholas V
 (Tomaso Parentucelli). Callistus III
 (Alfonso de Borja) and Pius II
 (Enea Silvio de’ Piccolomini) each
 issued one Bull denouncing the necromantic crew.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On 9 August, 1471, the Franciscan friar, Francesco della Rovere, ascended
 the throne of Peter as Sixtus IV. His Pontificate has been severely
 criticized by those who forget that the Pope was a temporal Prince and in
 justice bound to defend his territory against the continual aggression of
 the Italian despots. His private life was blameless, and the stories which
 were circulated by such writers as Stefano Infessura in his
 <i>Diarium</i> are entirely without
 foundation. Sixtus was an eminent theologian, he is the author of an
 admirable treatise on the Immaculate Conception, and it is significant that
 he took strong measures to curb the judicial severities of Tomàs de
 Torquemada, whom he had appointed Grand Inquisitor of Castile, 11 February,
 1482. During his reign he published three Bulls directly attacking sorcery,
 which he clearly identified with heresy, an opinion of the deepest weight
 when pronounced by one who had so penetrating a knowledge of the political
 currents of the day. There can be no doubt that he saw the society of witches
 to be nothing else than a vast international of anti-social revolutionaries.
 The first Bull is dated 17 June, 1473; the second 1 April. 1478; and the
 last 21 October, 1483.
 <p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It has been necessarily thus briefly to review this important series of
 Papal documents to show that the famous Bull <i>Summis desiderantes
 affectibus</i>, 9 December, 1484, which Innocent VIII addressed to the
 authors of the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>, is no isolated and extraordinary
 document, but merely one in the long and important record of Papal
 utterances. although at the same time it is of the greatest importance and
 supremely authoritative. It has, however, been very frequently asserted, not
 only be prejudiced and unscrupulous chroniclers, but also by scholars of
 standing and repute, that this Bull of Innocent VIII, if not, as many appear
 to suppose, actually the prime cause and origin of the crusade against
 witches, at any rate gave the prosecution and energizing power and an
 authority which hitherto they had not, and which save for this Bull they
 could not ever have, commanded and possessed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It will not be impertinent then here very briefly to inquire what authority
 Papal Bulls may be considered to enjoy in general, and what weight was, and
 is, carried by this particular document of 9 December, 1484.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To enter into a history of Bulls and Briefs would require a long and
 elaborate monograph, so we must be content to remind ourselves that the term
 <i>bulla</i>, which in classical Latin meant a water-bubble, a
 bubble then came to mean a boss of metal,
 such as the knob upon a door. (By
 transference it also implied a certain kind of amulet, generally made of
 gold, which was worn upon the neck, especially by noble youths). Hence in
 course of time the word <i>bulla</i> indicated the leaden seals by which
 Papal (and even royal) documents were authenticated, and by an easy
 transition we recognize that towards the end of the twelfth century a Bull
 is the document itself. Naturally very many kinds of edicts are issued from
 the Cancellaria, but a Bull is an instrument of especial weight and
 importance, and it differs both in form and detail from constitutions,
 encyclicals, briefs, decrees, privileges, and rescripts. It should be
 remarked, however, that the term Bull has conveniently been used to denote
 all these, especially if they are Papal letters of any early date. By the
 fifteenth century clearer distinctions were insisted upon and maintained.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A Bull was written in Latin and as late as the death of Pope Pius IX, 1878,
 the <i>scrittura bollatica</i>, an archaic and difficult type of Gothic
 characters much contracted and wholly unpunctuated was employed. This
 proved often well-nigh indecipherable to those who were not trained to the
 script, and accordingly there accompanied the Bull a <i>transsumptum</i> in
 an ordinary plain hand. The seal, appended by red and yellow (sometimes
 white) laces, generally bore on one side the figures of SS. Peter and Paul;
 on the other a medallion or the name of the reigning Pontiff.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A Bull begins thus: “N. Episcopus Seruus seruorum Dei ad perpetuam
 rei memoriam.” It is dated “Anno incarnationis Domini,”
 and also “Pontificatus Nostri anno primo (uel secundom, tertio, etc.).”
 Those Bulls which set forth and define some particular statement will be
 found to add certain minatory clauses directed against those who obstinately
 refuse to accept the Papal decision.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It should be remembered that, as has already been said, the famous Bull of
 Pope Innocent VIII is only one in a long line of Apostolic Letters dealing
 with the subject of witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On 18 June, 1485, the Pontiff again recommended the two Inquisitors to
 Berthold, Archbishop of Mainz, in a Bull <i>Pro causa fidei;</i> upon the
 same date a similar Bull was sent to the Archduke Sigismund, and a Brief to
 Abbot John of Wingarten, who is highly praised for his devotion and zeal. On
 30 September, 1486, a Bull addressed to the Bishop of Brescia and to Antonio
 di Brescia, O.P., Inquisitor for Lombardy, emphasizes the close connexion,
 nay, the identity of witchcraft with heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Alexander VI published two Bulls upon the same theme, and in a Bull of
 Julius II there is a solemn description of that abomination the Black Mass,
 which is perhaps the central feature of the worship of Satanists, and which
 is unhappily yet celebrated to-day in Londin, in Paris, in Berlin, and in
 many another great city.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Leo X, the great Pope of Humanism, issued on Bull on the subject; but even
 more important is the Bull <i>Dudum uti nobis exponi fecisti</i>, 20 July,
 1523, which speaks of the horrible abuse of the Sacrament in sorceries and
 the charms confuted by witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We have two briefs of Clement VII; and on 5 January, 1586, was published
 that long and weighty Constitution of Sixtus V, <i>Coeli et Terrae Creator
 Deus</i>, which denounces all those who are devoted to Judicial Astrology
 and kindred arts that are envenomed with black magic and goetry. There is a
 Constitution of Gregory XV, <i>Omnipotentis Dei</i>, 20 March, 1623; and a
 Constitution of Urban VIII, <i>Inscrutabilis iudiciorum Dei altitudo</i>,
 1 April, 1631, which - if we except the recent
 condemnation of Spiritism in the nineteenth
 century - may be said to be the last
 Apostolic document directed against these foul and devilish practices.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We may now consider the exact force of the Apostolic Bull <i>Summis
 desiderantes affectibus</i> issed on 9 December, 1484, by Innocent VIII to
 Fr. Henry Kramer and Fr. James Sprenger.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the first place, it is superflous to say that no Bull would have been
 published without the utmost deliberation, long considering of phrases, and
 above all earnest prayer. This document of Pope Innocent commences with the
 set grave formula of a Bull of the greatest weight and solemnity.
 “Innocentius Episcopus Seruus seruorum Dei ad perpetuam rei memoriam.”
 It draws to its conclusion with no brief and succinct prohibitory clauses
 but with a solemn measured period: “Non obstantibus praemissis ac
 constitutionibus et ordinationibus Apostolicis contrariis quibuscunque. . . .”
 The noble and momentous sentences are built up word by word, beat by beat,
 ever growing more and more authoritative, more and more judicial, until they
 culminate in the minatory and imprecatory clauses which are so impressive,
 so definite, that no loophole is left for escape, no turn for evasion.
 “Nulli ergo omnino hominum liceat hanc paganim nostrae declarationis
 extentionis concessionis et mandati infringere uel ei ausu temeraris
 contrarie Si qui autem attentate praesumpserit indignationem omnipotentis
 Dei ac beatorum Petri et Pauli Apostolorum eius se nouerit incursurum.”
 If any man shall presume to go against the tenor let him know that therein
 he will bring down upon himself the wrath of Almighty God and of the Blessed
 Apostles Peter and Paul.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Could words weightier be found?<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Are we then to class this Bull with the Bulla dogmatica <i>Ineffabilis Deus</i>
 wherein Pope Pius IX proclaimed the dogma of the Immaculate Conception? Such
 a position is clearly tenable, but even if we do not insist that the Bull of
 Innocent VIII is an infallible utterance, since the <i>Summis desiderantes
 affectibus</i> does not in set terms define a dogma although it does set
 forth sure and certain truths, it must at the very least be held to be a
 document of supreme and absolute authority, of
 dogmatic force. It belongs to that class
 of <i>ex cathedra</i> utterances “for which infallibility is claimed
 on the ground, not indeed of the terms of the Vatican definition, but of
 the constant practice of the Holy See, the consentient teaching of the
 theologians, as well as the clearest deductions of the principles of faith.”
 Accordingly the opinion of a person who rashly impugns this Bull is
 manifestly to be gravely censures as <i>erronea, sapiens haeresim, captiosa,
 subuersiua hierarchiae;</i> erroneous, savouring of heresy, captious,
 subversive of the hierarchy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Without exception non-Catholic historians have either in no measured
 language denounced or else with sorrow deplored the Bull of Innocent VIII as
 a most pernicious and unhappy document, a perpetual and irrevocable manifesto
 of the unchanged and unchangeable mind of the Papacy. From this point of
 view they are entirely justified, and their attitude is undeniably logical
 and right. The <i>Summis desideranted affectibus</i> is either a dogmatic
 exposition by Christ's Vicar upon earth or it is altogether abominable.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Hansen, either in honest error or of intent, willfully misleads when he
 writes, “it is perfectly obvious that
 the Bull pronounces no dogmatic decision.” As has been pointed out,
 in one very narrow and technical sense this may be correct - yet even here
 the opposite is arguable and probably true - but such a statement thrown
 forth without qualification is calculated to create, and undoubtedly does
 create, an entirely false impression. It is all the more amazing to find
 that the writer of the article upon “Witchcraft” in the
 <i>Catholic Encyclopaedia</i> quotes Hansen
 with complete approval and gleefully adds with regard to the Bull of Innocent
 VIII, “neither does the form suggest that the Pope wishes to bind
 anyone to believe more about the reality of witchcraft than is involved in
 the utterances of Holy Scripture,” a statement which is essentially
 Protestant in its nature, and, as is acknowledged by every historian of
 whatsoever colour or creed, entirely untrue. By its appearance in a standard
 work of reference, which is on the shelves of every library, this article
 upon “Witchcraft” acquires a certain title to consideration
 which upon its merits it might otherwise lack. It is signed Herbert Thurston,
 and turning to the list of “Contributors to the Fifteenth Volume”
 we duly see “Thurston, Herbert, S.J., London.” Since a Jesuit
 Father emphasizes in a well-known (and presumably authoritative) Catholic
 work an opinion so derogatory to the Holy See and so definitely opposed to
 all historians, one is entitled to express curiosity concerning other writings
 which may not have come from his pen. I find that for a considerable number
 of years Fr. Thurston has been contributing to <i>The Month</i> a series of
 articles upon mystical phenomena and upon various aspects of mysticism, such
 as the Incorruption of the bodies of Saints and Beati, the Stigmata, the
 Prophecies of holy persons, the miracles of Crucifixes that bleed or
 pictures of the Madonna which move, famous Sanctuaries, the inner life of and
 wonderful events connected with persons still living who have acquired a
 reputation for sanctity. This busy writer directly or incidentally has dealt
 with that famous ecstatica Anne Catherine
 Emmerich; the Crucifix of Limpias; Our Lady of Campocavallo; S. Januarus;
 the Ven. Maria d’Agreda; Gemma Galgani; Padre Pio Pietralcina; that
 gentle soul Teresa Higginson, the beauty of whose life has attracted
 thousands, but whom Fr. Thurston considers hysterical and masochistic and
 whose devotions to him savour of the “snowball” prayer; Pope
 Alexander VI; the origin of the Rosary; the Carmelite scapular; and very
 many themes beside. Here was have a mass of material, and even a casual
 glance through these pages will suffice to show the ugly prejudice which
 informs the whole. The intimate discussions on miracles, spiritual graces
 and physical phenomena, which above all require faith, reverence, sympathy,
 tact and understanding, are conducted with a roughness and a rudeness
 infinitely regrettable. What is worse, in every case Catholic tradition and
 loyal Catholic feeling are thrust to one side; the note of scepticism, of
 modernism, and even of rationalism is arrogantly dominant. Tender miracles
 of healing wrought at some old sanctuary, the records of some hidden life
 of holiness secretly lived amongst us in the cloister or the home, these
 things seem to provoke Fr. Thurston to such a pitch of annoyance that he
 cannot refrain from venting his utmost spleen. The obsession is certainly
 morbid. It is reasonable to suppose that a lengthy series of papers all
 concentrating upon certain aspects of mysticism would have collected in one
 volume, and it is extremely significant that in the autumn of 1923 a leading
 house announced among Forthcoming Books: “The Physical Phenomena of
 Mysticism. By the Rev. Herbert Thurston, S.J.” Although in active
 preparation, this has never seen the light. I have heard upon good authority
 that the ecclesiastical superiors took exception to such a publication. I
 may, of course, be wrong, and there can be no question that there is room
 for a different point of view, but I cannot divest my mind of the idea that
 the exaggerated rationalization of mystical phenomena conspicuous in the
 series of articles I have just considered may be by no means unwelcome to
 the Father of Lies. It really plays into his hands: first, because it makes
 the Church ridiculous by creating the impression that her mystics,
 particularly friars and nuns, are for the most part sickly hysterical
 subjects, deceivers and deceived, who would be fit inmates of Bedlam; that
 many of her most reverend shrines, Limpias,
 Campocavallo, and the sanctuaries of Naples, are frauds and conscious
 imposture; and, secondly, because it condemns and brings into
 ridicule that
 note of holiness which theologians declare is one of the distinctive marks
 of the true Church.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is also evil speaking of dignities. In 1924 the Right Rev. Mgr.
 Oeter de Roo published an historical work in five volumes, <i>Materials for
 a History of Pope Alexander VI, his Relatives and his Time</i>, wherein he
 demonstrates his thesis that Pope Alexander VI was “a man of good moral
 character and an excellent Pope.” This is quite enough for Fr.
 Thurston to assail him in the most vulgar and
 ill-bred way. The historian is a “crank,” “constitutionally
 incapable,” “extravagant,” and one who writes in “queer
 English,” and by rehabilitating Alexander VI has “wasted a good
 deal of his own time.” “One would be loath to charge him with
 deliberate <i>suggestio falis</i>,” smugly remarks Fr. Thurston, and
 of course directly conveys that impression. As to Pope Alexander, the most
 odious charges are one more hurled against the maligned Pontiff, and Fr.
 Thurston for fifteen nauseating pages insists upon “the evil example
 of his private life.” This is unnecessary; it is untrue; it shows
 contempt of Christ's Vicar on earth.

 <p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The most disquieting of all Fr. Thurston's writings that I know is without
 doubt his article upon the Holy House of Loreto, which is to be found in the
 <i>Catholic Encyclopaedia</i>, Vol. XIII, pp. 454-56, “Santa Casa di
 Loreto.” Here he jubilantly proclaims that “the Lauretan
 tradition is beset with difficulties of the gravest kind. These have been
 skilfully presented in the much-discussed work of Canon Chevalier,
 ‘Notre Dame de Lorette’ (Paris, 1906). . . . His argument remains
 intact and has as yet found no adequate reply.” This last assertion
 is simply incorrect, as Canon U. Chevalier's theories have been answered
 and demolished both by Father A. Eschbach, Procurator-General of the
 Congregation of the Holy Ghost, in his exhaustive work
 <i>La Vérité sur le Fair de
 Lorette</i>, and by the Rev. G. E. Phillips in his excellent study
 <i>Loreto and the Holy House</i>. From a
 careful reading of the article “Santa Casa di Loreto” it is
 obvious that the writer does not accept the fact of the Translation of the
 Holy House; at least that is the only impression I can gather from his words
 as, ignoring an unbroken tradition, the pronouncements of more than fifty
 Popes, the devotion of innumerable saints, the piety of countless writers,
 he gratuitously piles argument upon argument and emphasizes objection after
 objection to reduce the Translation of the House of Nazareth from Palestine
 to Italy to the vague story of a picture of the Madonna brought from Tersato
 in Illyria to Loreto. With reference to Canon Chevalier's work, so highly
 applauded by Fr. Thurston, it is well known that the late saintly Pontiff
 Pius X openly showed his great displeasure at the book, and took care to let
 it be widely understood that such an attack upon the Holy House
 sorely vexed and grieved him. In a Decree,
 12 April, 1916, Benedict XV, ordering the Feast of the Translation of the
 Holy House to be henceforward observed every year on the 10th December, in
 all the Dioceses and Religious Congregations of Italy and the adjacent Isles,
 solemnly and decisively declares that the Sanctuary of Loreto is “the
 House itself - translated from Palestine by the ministry of Angels - in
 which was born the Blessed Virgin Mary, and in which the Word was made
 Flesh.” In the face of this pronouncement it is hard to see how any
 Catholic can regard the Translation of the Holy House as a mere fairy tale
 to be classed with <i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i> or <i>Hop o’ my Thumb</i>.
 It is certain that Fr. Thurston's disedifying attack has given pain to
 thousands of pious souls, and in Italy I have heard an eminent theologian,
 an Archbishop, speak of these articles in terms of unsparing condemnation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Father Thurston is the author of a paper upon the subject of Pope Joan, but
 I am informed that it is no longer in print, and as I have not thought it
 worth while to make acquaintance with this lucubration I am unable to say
 whether he accepts the legend of this mythical dame as true or no.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 His bias evidently makes him incapable of dealing impartially with any
 historical fact, and even a sound and generally accepted theory would gain
 nothing by the adherence of so prejudiced an advocate. It has seemed worth
 while to utter a word of caution regarding his extraordinary output, and
 especially in our present connexion with reference to the article upon
 “Witchcraft,” which appears to me so little qualified to
 furnish the guidance readers may require in this difficult subject, and
 which by its inclusion in a standard work of reference might be deemed
 trustworthy and reliable.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is very certain then that the Bull of Innocent VIII, <i>Summis desiderantes
 affectibus</i>, was at least a document of the highest authority, and that
 the Pontiff herein clearly intended to set forth dogmatic facts, although
 this can be distinguished from the defining of a dogma. A dogmatic fact is
 not indeed a doctrine of revelation, but it is so intimately connected with
 a revealed doctrine that it would be impossible to deny the dogmatic fact
 without contradicting or seriously impugning the dogma. It would not be very
 difficult to show that any denial of the teaching of Pope Innocent VIII must
 traverse the Gospel accounts of demoniacs, the casting out of devils by Our
 Saviour, and His Divine words upon the activities of evil spirits.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Giovanni Battista Cibò, the son of Arano Cibò and Teodorina de’
 Mare, was born at Genoa in 1432. His father, a high favourite with Callistus
 III (Alfonso de Borja), who reigned from 8 April, 1455, to 6 August, 1458,
 had filled with distinction the senatorial office at Rome in 1455, and under
 King René won great honour as Viceroy of Naples. Having entered the
 household of Cardinal Calandrini, Giovanni Battista Cibò was in 1467
 created Bisop of Savona by Paul II, in 1473 Bishop of Molfetta by Sixtus IV,
 who raised him to the cardinalate in the following year. In the conclave
 which followed the death of this Pontiff, his great supporter proved to be
 Guiliano della Rovere, and on 29 August, 1484, he ascended the Chair of S.
 Peter, taking the name of Innocent VIII in memory, it is said, of his
 countryman, the Genoese Innocent IV (Sinibaldo de’ Fieschi), who
 reigned from 25 June, 1243, to 7 December, 1254. The new Pope had to deal
 with a most difficult political situation, and before long found himself
 involved in a conflict with Naples. Innocent VIII made the most earnest
 endeavours to unite Christendom against the common enemy, the Turk, but the
 unhappy indecision among various princes unfortunately precluded any
 definite result, although the Rhodians surrendered to the Holy Father. As
 for Djem, the younger son of Mohammad II, this prince had fled for protection
 to the Knights of S. John, and Sultan Bajazet pledged himself to pay an
 annual allowance of 35,000 ducats for the safe-keeping of his brother. The
 Grand Master handed over Djem to the Pope and on 13 March, 1489, the Ottoman
 entered Rome, where he was treated with signal respect and assigned
 apartments in the Vatican itself.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Innocent VIII only canonized one Saint, the Margrave
 Leopold of Austria, who was raised to the Altar 6 January, 1485. However,
 on 31 May, 1492, he received from Sultan Bajazet the precious
 Relic of the Most Holy Lance with which
 Our Redeemer had been wounded by S. Longinus
 upon the Cross. A Turkish emir brought the Relic to Ancona, whence it was
 conveyed by the Bishop to Narni, when two Cardinals took charge of it and
 carried it to Rome. On 31 May Cardinal Hiulino della Rovere solemnly handed
 it in a crystal vessel to the Pope during a function at S. Maria del Popolo.
 It was then borne in procession to S. Peter's, and from the loggia of the
 protico the Holy Father bestowed his blessing upon the crowds, whilst the
 Cardinal della Rovere standing at his side exposed the Sacred Relic to the
 veneration of the thronging piazza. The Holy Lance, which is accounted one
 of the three great Relics of the Passion, is shown together with the Piece
 of the True Cross and S. Veronica's Veil at S. Peter's after Matins on Spy
 Wednesday and on Good Friday evening; after High Mass on Easter Day, and also
 several times during the course of Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. The
 Relics are exposed from the balcony over the statue of S. Veronica to the
 left of the Papal Altar. The strepitaculum is sounded from the balcony and
 then all present venerate the Lance, the Wood of the Cross, and the <i>Volto
 Santo</i>.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 One of the most important exterior events which marked the reign of Innocent
 was undoubtedly the fall of Granada, the last stronghold of the Moors in
 Spain, which city surrendered to Ferdinand of Aragon, who thereby with his
 Queen Isabella won the name of “Catholic,” on 2 January, 1492.
 The conquest of Granada was celebrated with public rejoicings and the most
 splendid fêtes at Rome. Every house was brilliant with candles; the
 expulsion of the Mohammedans was represented upon open stages in a kind of
 pantomime; and long processions visited the national church of Spain in the
 Piazza Navona, San Giacomo degli Spagnuoli, which had been
 erected in 1450.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On 25 July, 1492, Pope Innocent, who had long been sickly and ailing so
 that his only nourishment for many weeks was woman's milk, passed away in
 his sleep at the Vatican. They buried him in S. Peter's, this great and
 noble Pontiff, and upon his tomb, a work in bronze by Pollaiuolo, were
 inscribed the felicitous words: <i>Ego autem in Innocentia mea ingressus
 sum</i>.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The chroniclers or rather scandalmongers of the day, Burchard and Infessura,
 have done their best to draw the character of Innocent VIII in very black
 and shameful colours, and it is to be regretted that more than one historian
 has not only taken his cure from their odious insinuations and evil gossip,
 but yet further elaborated the story by his own lurid imagination. When we
 add thereto and retail as sober evidence the venom of contemporary satirists
 such as Marullo and the fertile exaggerations of melodramatic publicists
 such as Egidio of Viterbo, a very sensational grotesque is the result.
 During his youth Giovanni Battista Cibò had, it seems, become
 enamoured of a Neapolitan lady, by whom he was the father of two children,
 Franceschetto and Teodorina. As was proper, both son and daughter were
 provided for in an ample and munificent manner;
 in 1488 his father married Franceschetto to
 Maddalena, a daughter of Lorenzo de’ Medici. The lady Teodorina
 became the bride of Messer Gherardo Uso de’ Mare, a Genoese merchant
 of great wealth, who was also Papal Treasurer. The capital that has been
 made out of these circumstances is hardly to be believed. It is admitted
 that this is contrary to strict morality and to be reasonably blamed. But
 this intrigue has been taken as the grounds for accusations of the most
 unbridled licentiousness, the tale of a lewd and lustful life. So far as I
 am aware the only other evidence for anything of the kind is the mud thrown
 by obscure writers at a great and truly
 Christian, if not wholly blameless, successor of S. Peter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In spite of these few faults Innocent VIII was a Pontiff who at a most
 difficult time worthily filled his Apostolic dignity. In his public office
 his constant endeavours for peace; his tireless efforts to unite Christendom
 against their common foe, the Turk; his opposition to the revolutionary
 Hussites in Bohemia and the anarchical Waldenses, two sources of the gravest
 danger, must be esteemed as worthy of the highest praise. Could he have
 brought his labours to fruition Europe would in later ages have been spared
 many a conflict and many a disaster.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Roscoe in reference to Innocent remarks:
 “The urbanity and mildness of his manners
 formed a striking contrast to the inflexible character of his predecessor.”
 And again: “If the character of Innocent
 were to be impartially weighed, the balance would incline, but with no very
 rapid motion, to the favourable side. His native disposition seems to have
 been mild and placable; but the disputed claims of the Roman See, which he
 conceived it to be his duty to enforce, led him into embarassments, from
 which he was with difficulty extricated, and which, without increasing his
 reputation, destroyed his repose.” We have here the judgement of
 a historian who is inclined to censure rather than to defend, and who
 certainly did not recognize, because he was incapable of appreciating, the
 almost overwhelming difficulties with which Innocent must needs contend if
 he were, as in conscience bound, to act as the chief Pastor of Christendom,
 a critical position which he needs must face and endeavour to control,
 although he were well aware that humanly speaking his efforts had no chance
 of success, whilst they cost him health and repose and gained him
 oppugnancy and misunderstanding.<br/>

 Immediately upon the receipt of the Bull, <i>Summis desiderantes affectibus</i>,
 in 1485, Fr. Henry Kramer commenced his crusade against witches at
 Innsbruck, but he was opposed on certain technical grounds by the Bishop of
 Brixen, nor was Duke Sigismund so ready to
 help the Inquisitors with the civil arm. In fact the prosecutions were,
 if not actually directed, at least largely controlled, by
 the episcopal authority; nor did the
 ordinary courts, as is so often supposed, invariably carry out the full
 sentence of the Holy Office. Not so very many years later, indeed, the civil
 power took full cognizance of any charges of witchcraft, and it was then
 that far more blood was spilled and far more fires blazed than ever in the
 days when Kramer and Sprenger were directing the trials. It should be borne
 in mind too that frequent disturbances, conspiracies of anarchists, and
 nascent Bolshevism showed that the district was rotted to the core, and the
 severities of Kramer and Sprenger were by no means so unwarranted as is
 generally supposed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On 6 June, 1474, Sprenger (Mag. Jacobus Sprenger) is mentioned as Prior of
 the Dominican house at Cologne, and on 8 February, 1479, he was present, as
 the socius of Gerhard von Elten, at the trial of John von Ruchratt of Wesel,
 who was found guilty of propagating the most subversive doctrines, and was
 sentenced to seclusion in the Augustinian monastery at Mainz, where he died
 in 1481.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Unfortunately full biographies of these two remarkable men, James Sprenger
 and Henry Kramer, have not been transmitted to us, but as many details
 have been succinctly collected in the <i>Scriptores Ordinis Praedicatorum</i>
 of Quétif and Echard, Paris, 1719, I have thought it convenient to
 transcribe the following accounts from that monumental work.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 F. Jacobus Sprenger (<i>sub anno</i> 1494). Fr. James Sprenger, a German by
 birth and a member of the community of the Dominican house at Cologne,
 greatly distinguished himself in his academic career at the University of
 that city. His name was widely known in the year 1468, when at the Chapter
 General of the Order which was held at Rome he was appointed Regent of
 Studies at the Formal House of Studies at Cologne, and the following is
 recorded in the statutes: <i>Fr. James Sprenger is officially appointed to
 study and lecture upon the Sentences so that he may proceed to the degree
 of Master</i>. A few years later, although he was yet quite a young man,
 since he had already proceeded Master, he was elected Prior and Regent of
 this same house, which important offices he held in the year 1475, and a
 little after, we are told, he was elected Provincial of the whole German
 Province. It was about this date that he was named by Sixtus IV General
 Inquisitor for Germany, and especially for the dioceses of Cologne and
 Mainz. He coadjutor was a Master of Sacred Theology, of the Cologne Convent,
 by name Fr. Gerard von Elten, who unfortunately died within a year or two.
 Pope Innocent VIII confirmed Fr. Sprenger in this office, and appointed Fr.
 Henry Kramer as his socius. Fr. Sprenger was especially distinguished on
 account of his burning and fearless zeal for the old faith, his vigilance,
 his constancy, his singleness and patience in correcting novel abuses and
 errors. We know that he was living in our house at Cologne at least as late
 as the year 1494, since the famous Benedictine Abbot
 John Trithemus refers to him in this year.
 It is most probable that he died and was buried among his brethren at
 Cologne. The following works are the fruit of his pen:

 1. <i>The Paradoxes of John of Westphalia, which he preached from the pulpit
 at Worms, disproved and utterly refuted by two Masters of Sacred Theology,
 Fr. Gerard von Elten of Cologne and Fr. James Sprenger.</i> Printed at
 Mainz, 1479.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 2. <i>Malleus Maleficarum Maleficat &amp; earum
 haeresim, ut framea potentissima conterens per F. Henricum Institoris &amp;
 Jacobum Sprengerum Ord. Praedic. Inquisitores</i>, which has run into
 many editions (see the notice of <i>Fr. Henry Kramer</i>). This book was
 translated into French as <i>Le Maillet des
 Sorcières</i>, Lyons, Stephanus Gueynard, 4to. See the
 <i>Bibliothèque Françoise du Verdier</i>.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 3. <i>The institution and approbation of the Society of Confraternity of the
 Most Holy Rosary which was first erected at Cologne on 8 September in the
 year 1475, with an account of many graces and Miracles, as also of the
 indulgences which have been granted to this said Confraternity.</i> I am
 uncertain whether he wrote and issued this book in Latin or in German, since
 I have never seen it, and it was certainly composed for the instruction and
 edification of the people. Moreover, it is reported that the following
 circumstances were the occasion of the found of this Society. In the year
 1475, when Nuess was being besieged by Charles,
 Duke of Burgunday, with a vast army, and the town was on the very point of
 surrender, the magistrates and chief burghers of Cologne, fearing the danger
 which threatened their city, resorted in a body to Fr. James, who was then
 Prior of the Convent, and besought him that if he knew of any plan or device
 which might haply ward off this disaster, he would inform them of it and
 instruct them what was best to be done. Fr. James, having seriously debated
 the matter with the senior members of the house, replied that all were
 agreed there could be no more unfailing and present remedy than to fly to
 the help of the Blessed Virgin, and that the very best way of effecting this
 would be if they were not only to honour the Immaculate Mother of God by
 means of the Holy Rosary which had been propagated several years ago by
 Blessed Alan de la Roche, but that they
 should also institute and erect a Society and Confraternity, in which every
 man should enrol himself with the firm resolve of thenceforth zealously and
 exactly fulfilling with a devout mind the obligations that might be required
 by the rules of membership. This excellent plan recommended itself to all.
 On the feast of the Nativity of Our Lady (8 September) the Society was
 inaugurated and High Mass was sung; there was a solemn procession throughout
 the city; all enrolled themselves and were inscribed on the Register; they
 fulfilled their duties continually with the utmost fervor, and before long
 the reward of their devotion was granted to them, since peace was made
 between the Emperor Frederick IV and Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgandy. In
 the following year, 1476, Alexander Nanni de Maltesta, Bishop of Forli
 and <i>legatus a latere</i> from Sixtus IV,
 who was then residing at Cologne, solemnly
 approved the Confraternity and on 10 March enriched it with many indulgences.
 And this is the first of those societies which are known as the
 Rosary Confraternirty to be erected and
 approved by the Apostolic authority. For in a short time, being enriched
 with so many indulgences, and new privileges and benefice being bestowed
 upon them almost daily, they have spread everywhere and they are to be found
 in almost every town and city throughout the whole of
 Christendom. It is worthy of remark that
 on the very same day that this Confraternity was erected at Cologne, Blessed
 Alan de la Roche of blessed memory, the most eminent promoter of the
 devotion of the Holy Rosary, died at Rostock;
 and his beloved disciple, Fr. Michel
 François de l’Isle, who was sometime Master of Sacred
 Theology at Cologne, gave Fr. Sprenger the most valuable assistance when the
 Rosary was being established, as we have related above. The works of Fr.
 James Sprenger are well approved by many authors as well as Trithemius;
 since amongst others who have praised him highly we may mention
 Albert Leander, O.P.;
 Antony of Siena, O.P.; Fernandez in his
 <i>Concert. &amp; Isto. del Rosar</i>, Lib. 4, cap. 1, fol. 127; Fontana in his
 <i>Theatro &amp; Monum</i>. published at Altamura, 1481; and, of authors not
 belonging to our Order, Antonius Possevinus,
 S.J., Miraeus, Aegidius Gelenius in his
 <i>De admirance Coloniae Agrippinae urbi Ubiorum Augustae magnitudine sacra
 &amp; ciuli</i>, Coloniae, 1645, 4to, p. 430;
 Dupin, and very many more.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Of Henry Kramer, Jacques Quétif and Echard, <i>Scriptores Ordini
 Praedicatorum</i>, Paris, 1719, Vol. 1, pp. 896-97, <i>sub anno</i> 1500,
 give the following account: Fr. Henry Kramer (F. Henricus Institorus) was of
 German nationality and a member of the German Province. It is definitely
 certain the he was a Master of Sacred Theology, which holy science he
 publicly professed, although we have not been able to discover either in
 what town of Germany he was born, in what Universities he lectured, or in
 what house of the Order he was professed. He was, however, very greatly
 distinguished by he zeal for the Faith, which he most bravely and most
 strenuously defended both by his eloquence in the pulpit and on the printed
 page, and so when in those dark days various errors had begun to penetrate
 Germany, and witches with their horrid craft, foul sorceries, and devilish
 commerce were increasing on every side, Pope Innocent VIII, by Letters
 Apostolic which were given at Rome at S. Peter's in the first year of his
 reign, 1484, appointed Henry Kramer and James Sprenger, Professors of Sacred
 Theology, general Inquisitors for all the dioceses of the five metropolitan
 churches of Germany, that is to say, Mainz, Cologne, Trèves, Salzburg,
 and Bremen. They showed themselves most zealous in the work which they had
 to do, and especially did they make inquisition for witches and for those
 who were gravely suspect of sorcery, all of whom they prosecuted with the
 extremest rigour of the law. Maximilian I, Emperor of Germany and King of
 the Romans, by royal letters patent which he signed at Brussels on 6
 November, 1486, bestowed upon Fr. Kramer and Fr. Sprenger the enjoyment of
 full civil powers in the performance of their duties as Inquisitors, and he
 commanded that throughout his dominions all should obey the two delegates
 of the Holy Office in their business, and should be ready and willing to
 help them upon every occasion. For several years Fr. Henry Kramer was
 Spiritual Director attached to our Church at Salzburg, which important office
 he fulfilled with singular great commendation. Thence he was summoned in the
 year 1495 to Venice by the Master-General of the Order, Fr. Joaquin de
 Torres, in order that he might give public lectures, and hold disputations
 concerning public worship and the adoration of the Most Holy Sacrament. For
 there were some theologians about this date who taught that the Blessed
 Sacrament must only be worshipped conditionally, with an implicit and
 intellectual reservation of adoring the Host in the tabernacle only in so
 far as It had been duly and exactly consecrated. Fr. Kramer, whose
 disputations were honoured by the presence of the
 Patriarch of Venice, with the utmost
 fervour publicly confronted those who maintained this view, and not
 infrequently did he preach against them from the pulpit. The whole question
 had recently arisen from a certain circumstance which happened in the vicinity
 of Padua. When a country fellow was collecting wood and dry leaves in a
 little copse hard by the city he found, wrapped up in a linen cloth beneath
 some dry brambles and bracken and dead branches of trees, two pyxes or
 ciboria containing particles which some three years before had been stolen
 from a neighbouring church, the one of which was used to carry the Lord's
 Body to the sick, the other being provided for the exposition of the
 Sanctissimum on the feast of Corpus Christi. The rustic immediately reported
 what he had discovered to the parish priest of the chapel hard by the
 spinnery. The good Father immediately hastened to the spot and saw that it
 was exactly as had been told him. When he more closely examined the vessels
 he found in one pyx a number of Hosts, and so fetching thither from the
 church a consecrated altar-stone which it was the custom to carry when the
 Viaticum was taken to the dying in order that the ciborium might be decently
 set thereon, he covered the stone with a corporal or a friar linen cloth and
 reverently placed it beneath the pyx. He built all around a little wooden
 baldaquin or shrine, and presently put devout persons to watch the place so
 that no indignity might be done. Meanwhile the incident had been noised
 abroad and vast throngs of people made their way to the place where the
 thicket was; candles were lighted all around; “Christ's Body,”
 they cry, “is here”; and every knee bent in humblest adoration.
 Before long news of the event was reported to the
 Bishop of Padua, who, having sent thither
 tow or three priests, inquired most carefully into every detail. Since in
 the other ciborium they only found some corrupted particles of the
 Sacramental Species, in the sight of the whole multitude the clerics who
 had come from the Bishop broke down the tiny tabernacle that had been
 improvised, scattered all the boughs and leafery which were arranged about
 it, extinguished the tapers, and carried the sacred vessels away with them.
 Immediately after it was forbidden under severest penalties of ecclesiastical
 censures and excommunication itself for anyone to visit that spot or to
 offer devotions there. Moreover, upon this occasion certain priests preached
 openly that the people who resorted thither had committed idolatry, that
 they had worshipped nothing else save brambles and decay, trees, nay, some
 went so far as to declare that they had adored the devil himself. As might
 be supposed, very grave contentions were set astir between the parish priests
 and their flocks, and it was sharply argued whether the people had sinned by
 their devotion to Christ's Body, Which they sincerely believed to be there,
 but Which (it seems) perhaps was not there: and the question was then mooted
 whether a man ought not to worship the Blessed Sacrament, ay, even when
 Christ's Body is consecrated in the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass and elevated
 and carried as Viaticum in procession to the sick, only conditionally, that
 is to say, since he does not perhaps know if It is actually Christ's Body
 (or whether some accident may not have occurred), since no mane can claim to
 be individually enlightened to by God on this point and desire to have the
 Mystery demonstrated and proved to him. It
 was much about the same thing that Fr. Kramer undertook to refute and
 utterly disprove the bold and wicked theories put forward by another preacher
 who at Augsburg dared to proclaim from the pulpit that the Catholic Church
 had not definitely laid down that the appearances of Christ in His human
 body, and sometimes bleeding from His Sacred Wounds, in the
 Blessed Sacrament are real and true
 manifestations of Our Saviour, but that it may be disputed whether Our Lord
 is truly there and truly to be worshipped by the people. This wretch even
 went so far as to say that miracles of this kind should be left as it were
 to the good judgement of God, inasmuch as with regard to these miraculous
 appearances nothing had been strictly defined by the Church, nor yet do the
 Holy Fathers or Doctors lay down and sure and certain rule. These doctrines
 Fr. Kramer opposed with the utmost zeal and learning, delivering many an
 eloquent sermon against the innovator and utterly condemning the theories
 which had been thus put forth and proclaimed. Nay, more, by virtue of his
 position and his powers as delegate of the Holy Office he forbade under the
 pain of excommunication that anyone should ever again dare to preach such
 errors. Fr. Kramer wrote several works, of which some have been more than
 once reprinted:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 1. <i>Malleus Maleficarum Maleficas &amp; earum haeresim, ut framea potentissima
 conterens per F. Henricum Institorem &amp; Jacobum Sprengerem ord. Praed.
 Inquisitores</i>, Lyons, Junta, 1484. This
 edition is highly praised by Fontana in his work <i>De Monumentis</i>.
 Another edition was published at Paris, <i>apud Joannem Paruum</i>, 8vo;
 also at Cologne, <i>apud Joanem Gymnicium</i>, 8vo, 1520; and another
 edition <i>apud Nicolaum Bassaeum</i> at Frankfort, 8vo, 1580 and 1582 (also
 two vols., 12mo, 1588). The editions of 1520, 1580, and 1582 are to be found
 in the Royal Library, Nos. 2882, 2883, and 2884. The editions printed at
 Venice in 1576 and at Lyons in 1620 are highly praised by Dupin. The latest
 edition is published at Lyons, <i>Sumptibus
 Claudi Bourgeat</i>, 4 vols., 1669. The <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>, when
 submitted by the authors to the University of Cologne was officially
 approved by all the Doctors of the Theological Faculty on 9 May, 1487.<br/>

 4. <i>The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman Church against the
 Picards and Waldenses.</i> This was
 published when Fr. Kramer was acting as Censor of the Faith under
 Alexander VI in Bohemia and Moldavia.
 This work is praised by the famous Dominican writer
 Noel Alexandre in his <i>Selecta
 historiae ecclesiasticae capita et in loca eiusdem insignia dissertationes
 historicae, criticae, dogmaticae</i>. In dealing with the fifteenth century
 he quotes passages from this work. The bibliographer Beugheim catalogues an
 edition of this work among those Incunabula the exact date of which cannot
 be traced. Georg Simpler, who was Rector of the University of Pforzheim,
 and afterwards Professor of Jurisprudence of Tubingen in the early decades
 of the sixteenth century, also mentions this work with commendation.
 Odorico Rinaldi quotes from this work
 in his <i>Annales</i> under the year 1500. The <i>Sermons</i> of 1496 are
 highly praised by Antony of Siena, O.P.
 Antonius Possevinus, S.J., speaks of a treatise <i>Against the Errors of
 Witches</i>. This I have never seen, but I feel very well assured that it is
 no other work than the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>, which was written in
 collaboration with Fr. James Sprenger, and which we have spoken above in
 some detail.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In what year Fr. Henry Kramer died and to what house of the Order he was
 then attached is not recorded, but it seems certain that he was living at
 least as late as 1500.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thus Quétif-Echard, but we may not impertinently add a few, from
 several, formal references which occur in Dominican registers and archives.
 James Sprenger was born at Basel (he is called <i>de Basilea</i> in a MS.
 belonging to the Library of Basel), probably about 1436038, and he was
 admitted as a Dominican novice in 1452 at the convent of his native town.
 An extract “ex monumentis contuent. Coloniens.” says that
 Sprenger “beatus anno 1495 obiit Argentinae ad S. Nicolaum in Undis
 in conuentu sororum ordinis nostri.” Another account relates that he
 did not die at Strasburg on 6 December, 1495, but at Verona, 3 February,
 1503, and certainly Jacobus Magdalius in his <i>Stichologia</i> has
 “In mortem magistri Iacobi Sprenger, sacri ordinis praedicatorii per
 Theutoniam prouincialis, Elegia,” which commences:<p>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 O utinam patrio recubassent ossa sepulchro<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Quae modo Zenonis urbe sepulta
 iacent.<p>

 Henry Kramer, who appears in the Dominican registers as “Fr. Henricus
 Institoris de Sletstat,” was born about 1430. His later years were
 distinguished by the fervour of his apostolic missions in Bohemia, where
 he died in 1505.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Although, as we have seeb, Fr. Henry Kramer and Fr. James Sprenger were men
 of many activities, it is by the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> that they will
 chiefly be remembered. There can be no doubt that this work had in its day
 and for a full couple of centuries an enormous influence. There are few
 demonologists and writers upon witchcraft who do not refer to its pages as
 an ultimate authority. It was continually quoted and appealed to in the
 witch-trials of Germany, France, Italy, and England; whilst the methods and
 examples of the two Inquisitors gained an even more extensive credit and
 sanction owing to their reproduction (sometimes without direct
 acknowledgement) in the works of Bedin, De Lancre, Boguet, Remy, Tartarotti,
 Elich, Grilland, Pons, Godelmann, de Moura, Oberlal, Cigogna, Peperni,
 Martinus Aries, Anania, Binsfeld, Bernard Basin, Menghi, Stampa, Clodius,
 Schelhammer, Wolf, Stegmann, Neissner, Voigt, Cattani, Ricardus, and a
 hundred more. King James has drawn (probably indirectly) much of his
 <i>Daemonologie, in Forme of a Dialogue,
 Divided into three Bookes</i> from the pages of the <i>Malleus</i>; and
 Thomas Shadwell, the Orance laureate, in his “Notes upon the
 Magick” of his famous play, <i>The
 Lancashire Witches</i>, continually quotes from the same source.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To some there may seem much in the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> that is crude,
 much that is difficult. For example, the etymology will provoke a smile.
 The derivation of <i>Femina</i> from
 <i>fe minus</i> is notorious, and hardly less awkward is the statement that
 <i>Diabolus</i> comes “a Dia,
 quod est duo, et bolus, quod est morsellus; quia duo occidit, scilicet
 corpus et animam.” Yet I venture to say that these blemishes - such
 gross blunders, of you will - do not affect the real contexture and weight
 of this mighty treatise.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Possibly what will seem even more amazing to modern readers is the misogynic
 trend of various passages, and these not of the briefest nor least pointed.
 However, exaggerated as these may be, I am not altogether certain that they
 will not prove a wholesome and needful antidote in this feministic age,
 when the sexes seem confounded, and it appear to be the chief object of many
 females to ape the man, an indecorum by which they not only divest themselves
 of such charm as they might boast, but lay themselves open to the sternest
 reprobation in the name of sanity and common-sense. For the Apostle S. Peter
 says: “Let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any believe
 not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the
 wives, considering your chaste conversation with fear. Whose adorning let it
 not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of god, or the
 putting on of apparel; but the hidden man of the heart is the incorruptibility
 of a quiet and meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God. For after the
 manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted God, adorned themselves,
 being in subjection to their own husbands: as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling
 him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well, and not fearing any
 disturbance.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 With regard to the sentences pronounced upon witches and the course of their
 trials, we may say that these things must be considered in reference and in
 proportion to the legal code of the age. Modern justice knows sentences of
 the most ferocious savagery, punishments which can only be dealt out by
 brutal vindictiveness, and these are often meted out to offences concerning
 which we may sometimes ask ourselves whether
 they are offences at all; they certainly do no harm to society, and no
 harm to the person. Witches were the bane of all social order; they injured
 not only persons but property. They were, in fact, as has previously been
 emphasized, the active members of a vast revolutionary body, a conspiracy
 against civilization. Any other save the most thorough measures must have
 been unavailing; worse, they must have but fanned the flame.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And so in the years to come, when the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> was used
 as a standard text-book, supremely authoritative practice winnowed the little
 chaff, the etymologies, from the wheat of wisdom. Yet it is safe to say that
 the book is to-day scarcely known save by name. It has become a legend.
 Writer after writer, who had never turned the pages, felt himself at liberty
 to heap ridicule and abuse upon this venerable volume. He could quote -
 though he had never seen the text - an etymological absurdity or two, or if
 in more serious vein he could prate glibly enough of the publication of the
 <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> as a “most disastrous episode.” He
 did not know very clearly what he meant, and the humbug trusted that nobody
 would stop to inquire. For the most part his confidence was respected; his
 word was taken.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We must approach this great work - admirable in spite of its triffling
 blemishes - with open minds and grave intent; if we duly consider the world
 of confusion, of Bolshevism, of anarchy and licentiousness all around to-day,
 it should be an easy task for us to picture the difficulties, the hideous
 dangers with which Henry Kramer and James Sprenger were called to combat and
 to cope; we must be prepared to discount certain plain faults, certain
 awkwardnesses, certain roughness and even severities; and then shall we be
 in a position dispassionately and calmy to pronounce opinion upon the value
 and the merit of this famouse treatise.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As for myself, I do not hesitate to record my judgement. Literary merits and
 graces, strictly speaking, were not the aim of the authors of the <i>Malleus
 Maleficarum</i>, although there are felicities not a few to be found in
 their admirable pages. Yet I dare not even hope that the flavour of Latinity
 is preserved in a translation which can hardly avoid being jejune and bare.
 The interest, then, lies in the subject-matter. And from this point of view
 the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> is one of the most pregnant and most
 interesting books I know in the library of its kind - a kind which, as it
 deals with eternal things, the eternal conflict of good and evil, must
 eternally capture the attention of all men who think, all who see, or are
 endeavouring to see, reality beyond the accidents of matter, time, and
 space.<p><br/><br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It has been observed that “it is quite impossible to appreciate and
 understand the true and inner lives of men and women in Elizabethan and
 Stuart England, in the France of Louis XIII and during the long reign of
 his son and successor, in Italy of the Renaissance and the Catholic
 Reaction - to name but three European countries and a few definite periods -
 unless we have some realization of the part that Witchcraft played in those
 ages amid the affairs of these Kingdoms. All classes were affected and
 concerned from Pope to peasant, from Queen to cottage girl.”
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Witchcraft was inextricably mixed with politics. Matthew Paris tells us
 how in 1232 the Chief Justice Hubert de Burgh, Earl of Kent, (Shakespeare's
 “gentle Hubert” in <i>King John</i>), was accused by Peter do Roches, Bishop of
 Winchester, of having won the favour of Henry III through “charms and
 incantations”. In 1324 there was a terrific scandal at Coventry when it was
 discovered that a number of the richest and most influential burghers of the
 town had long been consulting with Master John, a professional necromancer,
 and paying him large sums to bring about by his arts the death of Edward II
 and several nobles of the court. Alice Perrers, the mistress pf Edward III,
 was not only reputed to have infatuated the old King by occult spells, but
 her physician (believed to be a mighty sorcerer) was arrested on a charge of
 confecting love philtres and talismans. Henry V, in the autumn of 1419,
 prosecuted his stepmother, Joan of Navarre, for attempting to kill him by
 witchcraft, “in the most horrible manner that one could devise.” The
 conqueror of Agincourt was exceedingly worried about the whole wretched
 business, as also was the Archbishop of Canterbury, who ordered public
 prayers for the King's safety. In the reign of his son, Henry VI, in 1441,
 one of the highest and noblest ladies in the realm, Eleanor Cobham, Duchess
 of Gloucester, was arraigned for conspiring with “a clerk”, Roger
 Bolingbroke, “a most notorious evoker of demons”, and “the most famous
 scholar in the whole world in astrology in magic”, to procure the death of
 the young monarch by sorcery, so that the Duke of Gloucester, Henry's uncle
 and guardian, might succeed to the crown. In this plot were further involved
 Canon Thomas Southwell, and a “relapsed witch”, that is to say, one who had
 previously (eleven years before) been incarcerated upon grave suspicion of
 black magic, Margery Jourdemayne. Bolingbroke, whose confession implicated
 the Duchess, was hanged; Canon Southwell died in prison; the witch in
 Smithfield was “burn'd to Ashes”, since her offence was high treason. The
 Duchess was sentenced to a most degrading public penance, and imprisoned for
 life in Peel Castle, Isle of Man. Richard III, upon seizing the throne in
 1483, declared that the marriage of his brother, Edward IV, with the Lady
 Elizabeth Grey, had been brought about by “sorcery and witchcraft”, and
 further that “Edward's wife, that monstrous witch, has plotted with Jane
 Shore to waste and wither his body.” Poor Jane Shore did most exemplary
 penance, walking the flinty streets of London barefoot in her kirtle. In
 the same year when Richard wanted to get rid of the Duke of Buckingham, his
 former ally, one of the chief accusations he launched was that the Duke
 consulted with a Cambridge “necromancer” to compass and devise his death.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 One of the most serious and frightening events in the life of James VII
 of Scotland (afterwards James I of England) was the great conspiracy of
 1590, organized by the Earl of Bothwell.

 James with good reason feared and
 hated Bothwell, who, events amply proved, was Grand Master of more than one
 hundred witches, all adepts in poisoning, and all eager to do away with the
 King. In other words, Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, was the centre and
 head of a vast political plot. A widespread popular panic was the result of
 the discovery of this murderous conspiracy.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In France as early as 583, when the infant son and heir of King Chilperic,
 died of dysentery, as the doctors diagnosed it, it came to light that
 Mumolus, one of the leading officials of the court, had been secretly
 administering to the child medicines, which he obtained from “certain
 witches of Paris”. These potions were pronounced by the physicians to be
 strong poisons. In 1308, Guichard, Bishop of Troyes, was accused of having
 slain by sorcery the Queen of Philip IV of France (1285-1314), Jeanne of
 Navarre, who died three years before. The trial dragged on from 1308 to
 1313, and many witnesses attested on oath that the prelate had continually
 visited certain notorious witches, who supplied him philtres and draughts.
 In 1315, during the brief reign (1314-1316) of Louis X, the eldest son of
 Philip IV, was hanged Enguerrand de Marigny, chamberlain, privy councillor,
 and chief favourite of Philip, whom, it was alleged, he had bewitched to
 gain the royal favour. The fact, however, which sealed his doom was his
 consultation with one Jacobus de Lor, a warlock, who was to furnish a
 nostrum warranted to put a very short term to the life of King Louis.
 Jacobus strangled himself in prison.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In 1317 Hugues Géraud, Bishop of Cahors, was executed by Pope John
 XXII, who reigned 1316-1334, residing at Avignon. Langlois says that the
 Bishop had attempted the Pontiff's life by poison procured from witches.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Perhaps the most resounding of all scandals of this kind in France was the
 La Voison case, 1679-1682, when it was discovered that Madame de Montespan
 had for years been trafficking with a gang of poisoners and sorcerers, who
 plotted the death of the Queen and the Dauphan, so that Louis XIV might be
 free to wed Athénais de Montespan, whose children should inherit the
 throne. The Duchesse de Fontanges, a beautiful young country girl, who had
 for a while attracted the wayward fancy of Louis, they poisoned out of hand.
 Money was poured out like water, and it has been said that “the entire
 floodtide of poison, witchcraft and diabolism was unloosed” to attain the
 ends of that “marvellous beauty” (so Mme. de Sévigné calls her),
 the haughty and reckless Marquise de Montespan. In her thwarted fury she well
 nigh resolved to sacrifice Louis himself to her overweening ambition and her
 boundless pride. The highest names in France - the Princesse de Tingry, the
 Duchesse de Vitry, the Duchesse de Lusignan, the Duchesse de Bouillon, the
 Comtesse de Soissons, the Duc de Luxembourg, the Marguis de Cessac - scores
 of the older aristocracy, were involved, whilst literally hundreds of venal
 apothecaries, druggists, pseudo-alchemists, astrologers, quacks, warlocks,
 magicians, charlatans, who revolved round the ominous and terrible figure of
 Catherine La Voisin, professional seeress, fortune-teller, herbalist,
 beauty-specialist, were caught in the meshes of law. No less than eleven
 volumes of François Ravaison's huge work, <i>Archives de la Bastille</i>,
 are occupied with this evil crew and their doings, their sorceries and their
 poisonings.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 During the reign of Urban VIII, Maffeo Barberini, 1623-1644, there was a
 resounding scandal at Rome when it was discovered that “after many invocations
 of demons” Giacinto Contini, nephew of the Cardinal d'Ascoli, had been
 plotting with various accomplices to put an end to the Pope's life, and thus
 make way for the succession of his uncle to the Chair of Peter. Tommaso
 Orsolini of Recanate, moreover, after consulting with certain scryers and
 planetarians, readers of the stars, was endeavouring to bribe the apothecary
 Carcurasio of Naples to furnish him with a quick poison, which might be
 mingled with the tonics and electuaries prescribed for the ailing Pontiff,
 (Ranke, <i>History of the Popes</i>, ed. 1901, Vol. III, pp. 375-6).
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To sum up, as is well observed by Professor Kittredge, who more than once
 emphasized “I have no belief in

 the black art or in the interference of demons in the daily life of
 mortals”, it makes no difference whether any of the charges were true or
 whether the whole affairs were hideous political chicanery. “Anyhow, it
 reveals the beliefs and the practices of the age.”
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Throughout the centuries witchcraft was universally held to be a dark and
 horrible reality; it was an ever-present, fearfully ominous menace, a thing
 most active, most perilous, most powerful and true. Some may consider these
 mysteries and cantrips and invocations, these sabbats and rendezvous, to
 have been merest mummery and pantomime, but there is no question that the
 psychological effect was incalculable, and harmful in the highest degree. It
 was, to use a modern phrase, “a war of nerves”. Jean Bodin, the famous
 juris-consult (1530-90) whom Montaigne acclaims to be the highest literary
 genius of his time, and who, as a leading member of the Parlement de Paris,
 presided over important trials, gives it as his opinion that there existed,
 no only in France, a complete organization of witches, immensely wealthy, of
 almost infinite potentialities, most cleverly captained, with centres and
 cells in every district, utilizing an espionage in ever land, with high-placed
 adherents at court, with humble servitors in the cottage. This organization,
 witchcraft, maintained a relentless and ruthless war against the prevailing
 order and settled state. No design was too treacherous, no betrayal was too
 cowardly, no blackmail too base and foul. The Masters lured their subjects
 with magnificent promises, they lured and deluded and victimized. Not the
 least dreaded and dreadful weapon in their armament was the ancient and
 secret knowledge of poisons (<i>veneficia</i>), of herbs healing and hurtful,
 a tradition and a lore which had been handed down from remotest antiquity.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Little wonder, then, that later social historians, such as Charles Mackay
 and Lecky, both absolutely impartial and unprejudiced writers, sceptical
 even, devote many pages, the result of long and laborious research, to
 witchcraft. The did not believe in witchcraft as in any sense supernatural,
 although perhaps abnormal. But the centuries of which they were writing
 believed intensely in it, and it was their business as scholars to examine
 and explain the reasons for such belief. It was by no means all mediæval
 credulity and ignorance and superstition. MacKay and Lecky fully recognized
 this, as indeed they were in all honesty bound to do. They met with facts,
 hard facts, which could neither have been accidents nor motiveless, and
 these facts must be accounted for and elucidated. The profoundest thinkers,
 the acutest and most liberal minds of their day, such men as Cardan;
 Trithemius; the encylcopædic Delrio; Bishop Binsfeld; the learned
 physician, Caspar Peucer; Jean Bodin; Sir Edward Coke, “father of the
 English law”; Francis Bacon; Malebranche; Bayle; Glanvil; Sir Thomas Browne;
 Cotton Mather; all these, and scores besides, were convinced of the dark
 reality of witchcraft, of the witch organization. Such a consensus of
 opinion throughout the years cannot be lightly dismissed.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The literature of the subject, discussing it in every detail, from every
 point of view, from every angle, is enormous. For example, such a Bibliography
 as that of Yve-Plessis, 1900, which deals only with leading French cases and
 purports to be no more than a supplement to the Bibliographies of Græsse,
 the Catalogues of the Abbé Sépher, Ouvaroff, the comte d'Ourches,
 the forty-six volumes of Dr. Hoefer, Shieble, Stanislas de Guaita, and many
 more, lists nearly 2,000 items, and in a note we are warned that the work is
 very far from complete. The <i>Manuel Bibliographique</i>, 3 vols., 1912, of
 Albert L. Caillet, gives 11,648 items. Caillet has many omissions, some being
 treatises of the first importance. The library of witchcraft may without
 exaggeration be said to be incalculable.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is hardly disputed that in the whole vast literature of witchcraft, the
 most prominent, the most important, the most authorative volume is the
 <i>Malleus Maleficarum (The Witch Hammer)</i> of Heinrich Kramer (Henricus
 Institoris) and James Sprenger. The date of the first edition of the
 <i>Malleus</i> cannot be fixed with absolute certainty, but the likeliest
 year is 1486. There were, at any rate, fourteen editions between 1487

 and 1520, and at least sixteen editions between 1574 and 1669. These were
 issued from the leading German, French and Italian presses. The latest
 reprint of the original text of the <i>Malleus</i> is to be found in the
 noble four volume collection of Treatises on Witchcraft, “sumptibus Claudii
 Bourgeat”, 4to., Lyons, 1669. There is a modern German translation by J.W.R.
 Schmidt, <i>Der Hexehammer</i>, 3 vols., Berlin, 1906; second edition,
 1922-3. There is also an English translation with Introduction, Bibliography,
 and Notes by Montague Summers, published John Rodker, 1928.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The <i>Malleus</i> acquired especial weight and dignity from the famous Bull
 of Pope Innocent VIII, <i>Summis desiderantes affectibus</i> of 9 December,
 1484, in which the Pontiff, lamenting the power and prevalence of the witch
 organization, delegates Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger as inquisitors of
 these pravities throughout Northern Germany, particularly in the provinces
 and dioceses of Mainz, Cologne, Tréves, Salzburg, and Bremen, granting
 both and either of them an exceptional authorization, and by Letters Apostolic
 requiring the Bishop of Strasburg, Albrecht von Bayern (1478-1506), not
 only to take steps to publish and proclaim the Bull, but further to afford
 Kramer and Sprenger every assistance, even calling in, if necessary, the help
 of the secular arm.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This Bull, which was printed as the Preface to the <i>Malleus</i>, was thus,
 comments Dr. H.C. Lea, “spread broadcast over Europe”. In fact, “it fastened
 on European jurisprudence for nearly three centuries the duty of combating”
 the Society of Witches. The <i>Malleus</i> lay on the bench of every
 magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority. It was
 implicitly accepted not only by Catholic but by Protestant legislature. In
 fine, it is not too much to say that the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> is among
 the most important, wisest, and weightiest books of the world.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It has been asked whether Kramer or Sprenger was principally responsible for
 the <i>Malleus</i>, but in the case of so close a collaboration any such
 inquiry seems singularly superflous and nugatory. With regard to instances
 of jointed authorship, unless there be some definite declaration on the part
 of one of the authors as to his particular share in a work, or unless there
 be some unusual and special circumstances bearing on the point, such
 perquisitions and analysis almost inevitably resolve themselves into a cloud
 of guess-work and bootless hazardry and vague perhaps. It becomes a game of
 literary blind-man's-bluff.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Heinrich Kramer was born at Schlettstadt, a town of Lower Alsace, situated
 some twenty-six miles southwest of Strasburg. At an early age he entered the
 Order of S. Dominic, and so remarkable was his genius that whilst still a
 young man he was appointed to the position of Prior of the Dominican House
 at his native town, Schlettstadt. He was a Preacher-General and a Master of
 Sacred Theology. P.G. and S.T.M., two distinctions in the Dominican Order.
 At some date before 1474 he was appointed an Inquisitor for the Tyrol,
 Salzburg, Bohemia, and Moravia. His eloquence in the pulpit and tireless
 activity received due recognition at Roma, and for many years he was
 Spiritual Director of the great Dominican church at Salzburg, and the
 right-hand of the Archbishop of Salzburg, a munificent prelat who praises
 him highly in a letter which is still extant. In the late autumn or winter
 of 1485 Kramer had already drawn up a learned instruction or treatise on the
 subject of witchcraft. This circulated in manuscript, and is (almost in its
 entirety) incorporated in the <i>Malleus</i>. By the
 Bull of Innocent VIII in December, 1484, he had already been associated
 with James Sprenger to make inquisition for and try witches and sorcerers.
 In 1495, the Master General of the Order, Fr. Joaquin de Torres, O.P.,
 summoned Kramer to Venice in order that he might give public lectures,
 disputations which attracted crowded audiences, and which were honoured by
 the presence and patronage of the Patriarch of Venice. He also strenuously
 defended the Papal supremacy, confuting the <i>De Monarchia</i> of the
 Paduan jurisconsult, Antonio degli Roselli. At Venice he resided at the
 priory of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo). During the summer of 1497,
 he had returned to Germany, and was living at the convent of Rohr, near
 Regensburg. On 31 January, 1500, Alexander VI appointed him as Nuncio and
 Inquisitor of Bohemia and Moravia, in which provinces he was deputed and
 empowered to proceed against the Waldenses and Picards, as well as against
 the adherents of the witch-society. He wrote and preached with great fervour
 until the end. He died in Bohemia in 1505.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 His chief works, in addition to the <i>Malleus</i>, are: <i>Several
 Discourses and Various Sermons upon the Most Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist</i>;
 Nuremberg, 1496; <i>A Tract Confuting the Errors of Master Antonio degli
 Roselli</i>; Venice, 1499; and <i>The Shield of Defence of the Holy Roman
 Church Against the Picards and Waldenses</i>; an incunabulum, without date,
 but almost certainly 1499-1500. Many learned authors quote and refer to
 these treatises in terms of highest praise.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 James Sprenger was born in Basel, 1436-8. He was admitted a novice in the
 Dominican house of this town in 1452. His extraordinary genius attracted
 immediate attention, and his rise to a responsible position was very rapid.
 According to Pierre Hélyot, the Fransican (1680-1716), <i>Histoire
 des Ordres Religieux</i>, III (1715), ch. XXVI, in 1389 Conrad of Prussia
 abolished certain relaxations and abuses which had crept into the Teutonic
 Province of the Order of S. Dominic, and restored the Primitive and Strict
 Obedience. He was closely followed by Sprenger, whose zealous reform was so
 warmly approved that in 1468 the General Chapter ordered him to lecture on
 the sentences of Peter Lombard at the University of Cologne, to which he was
 thus officially attached. A few years later he proceeded Master of Theology,
 and was elected Prior and Regent of Studies of the Cologne Convent, one of
 the most famous and frequented Houses of the Order. On 30 June, 1480, he was
 elected Dean of the Faculty of Theology at the University. His lecture-room
 was thronged, and in the following year, at the Chapter held in Rome, the
 Master General of the Order, Fra Salvo Cusetta, appointed him Inquisitor
 Extraordinary for the Provinces of Mainz, Trèves, and Cologne. His
 activities were enormous, and demanded constant journeyings through the very
 extensive district to which he had been assigned. In 1488 he was elected
 Provincial of the whole German Province, an office of the first importance.
 It is said that his piety and his learning impressed all who came in contact
 with him. In 1495 he was residing at Cologne, and here he received a letter
 from Alexander VI praising his enthusiasm and his energy. He died rather
 suddenly, in the odour of sanctity - some chronicles call him “Beatus” -
 on 6 December, 1495, at Strasburg, where he is buried.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Among Sprenger's other writings, excepting the <i>Malleus</i>, are <i>The
 Paradoxes of John of Westphalia Refuted</i>, Mainz, 1479, a closely argued
 treatise; and <i>The Institution and Approbation of the Confraternity of
 the Most Holy Rosary, which was first erected at Cologne on 8 September
 in the year 1475</i>, Cologne, 1475. Sprenger may well be called the
 “Apostle of the Rosary”. None more fervent than he in spreading
 this Dominican elevation. His zeal enrolled thousands, including the
 Emperor Frederick III, in the Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary, which
 was enriched with many indulgences by a Bull of Sixtus IV. It has been
 observed that the writings of Father James Sprenger on the Rosary are well
 approved by many learned men, Pontiffs, Saints and Theologians alike. There
 can be no doubt that Sprenger was a mystic of the highest order, a man of
 most saintly life.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The Dominican chroniclers, such as Quétif and Echard, number Kramer
 and Sprenger among the glories and heroes of their Order.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Certain it is that the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> is the most solid, the
 most important work in the whole vast library of witchcraft. One turns to it
 again and again with edification and interest: From the point of psychology,
 from the point of jurisprudence, from the point of history, it is supreme.
 It has hardly too much to say that later writers, great as they are, have
 done little more than draw from the seemingly inexhaustible wells of wisdom
 which the two Dominicans, Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger, have given us
 in the <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i>.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 What is most surprising is the modernity of the book. There is hardly a
 problem, a complex, a difficulty, which they have not foreseen, and discussed,
 and resolved.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here are cases which occur in the law-courts to-day, set out with the
 greatest clarity, argued with unflinching logic, and judged with scrupulous
 impartiality.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is a work which must irresistibly capture the attention of all mean who
 think, all who see, or are endeavouring to see, the ultimate reality beyond
 the accidents of matter, time and space.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The <i>Malleus Maleficarum</i> is one of the world's few books written
 <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>.

<h2>Question I</h2>
<h3>Whether the Belief that there are such Beings as Witches is so Essential a Part of the Catholic Faith that Obstinacy to maintain the Opposite Opinion manifestly savours of Heresy.</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Whether the belief that there are such beings as witches is so essential a
 part of the Catholic faith that obstinately to maintain the opposite opinion
 manifestly savours of heresy. And it is argued that a firm belief in witches
 is not a Catholic doctrine: see chapter 26, question 5, of the work of
 Episcopus. Whoever believes that any creature can be changed for the better
 or the worse, or transformed into another kind or likeness, except by the
 Creator of all things, is worse than a pagan and a heretic. And so when they
 report such things are done by witches it is not Catholic, but plainly
 heretical, to maintain this opinion.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, no operation of witchcraft has a permanent effect among us. And
 this is the proof thereof: For if it were so, it would be effected by the
 operation of demons. But to maintain that the devil has power to change
 human bodies or to do them permanent harm does not seem in accordance with
 the teaching of the Church. For in this way they could destroy the whole
 world, and bring it to utter confusion.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, every alteration that takes place in a human body - for example,
 a state of health or a state of sickness - can be brought down to a question
 of natural causes, as Aristotle has shown in his 7th book of <i>Physics</i>.
 And the greatest of these is the influence of the stars. But the devils
 cannot interfere with the stars. This is the opinion of Dionysius in his
 epistle to S. Polycarp. For this alone God can do. Therefore it is evident
 the demons cannot actually effect any permanent transformation in human
 bodies; that is to say, no real metamorphosis. And so we must refer the
 appearance of any such change to some dark and occult cause.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the power of God is stronger than the power of the devil, so divine works
 are more true than demoniac operations. Whence inasmuch as evil is powerful
 in the world, then it must be the work of the devil always conflicting with
 the work of God. Therefore as it is unlawful to hold that the devil's evil
 craft can apparently exceed the work of God, so it us unlawful to believe
 that the noblest works of creation, that is to say, man and beast, can be
 harmed and spoiled by the power of the devil.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, that which is under the influence of a material object cannot have
 power over corporeal objects. But devils are subservient to certain
 influences of the stars, because magicians observe the course of certain
 stars in order to evoke the devils. Therefore they have not the power of
 effecting any change in a corporeal object, and it follows that witches have
 even less power than the demons possess.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For devils have no power at all save by a certain subtle art. But an art
 cannot permanently produce a true form. (And a certain author says: Writers
 on Alchemy know that there is no hope of any real transmutation.) Therefore
 the devils for their part, making use of the utmost of their craft, cannot
 bring about any permanent cure - or permanent disease. But if these states
 exist it is in truth owing to some other cause, which may be unknown, and
 has nothing to do with the operations of either devils or witches.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But according to the Decretals (33) the contrary is the case. “If by
 witchcraft or any magic art permitted by the secret but most just will of
 God, and aided by the power of the devil, etc . . . . ” The reference here
 is to any act of witchcraft which may hinder the end of marriage, and for
 this impediment to take effect three things can concur, that is to say,
 witchcraft, the devil, and the permission of God. Moreover, the stronger can
 influence that which is less strong. But the power of the devil is stronger
 than any human power (<i>Job xl</i>). There
 is no power upon earth which can be compared to him, who was created so
 that he fears none.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. Here are three heretical errors which must be met, and when
 they have been disproved the truth will be plain. For certain writers,
 pretending to base their opinion upon the words of S. Thomas (iv, 24) when
 he treats of impediments brought about by magic charms, have tried to
 maintain that there is not such a thing as magic, that it only exists in the
 imagination of those men who ascribe natural effects, the cause whereof are
 not known, to witchcraft and spells. There are others who acknowledge indeed
 that witches exist, but they declare that the influence of magic and the
 effects of charms are purely imaginary and phantasmical. A third class of
 writers maintain that the effects said to be wrought by magic spells are
 altogether illusory and fanciful, although it may be that the devil does
 really lend his aid to some witch.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The errors held by each one of these persons may thus be set forth and thus
 confuted. For in the very first place they are shown to be plainly heretical
 by many orthodox writers, and especially by S. Thomas, who lays down that
 such an opinion is altogether contrary to the authority of the saints and is
 founded upon absolute infidelity. Because the authority of the Holy
 Scriptures says that devils have power over the bodies and over the minds of
 men, when God allows them to exercise this power, as is plain from very many
 passages in the Holy Scriptures. Therefore those err who say that there is
 no such thing as witchcraft, but that it is purely imaginary, even although
 they do not believe that devils exist except in the imagination of the
 ignorant and vulgar, and the natural accidents which happen to a man he
 wrongly attributes to some supposed devil. For the imagination of some men
 is so vivid that they think they see actual figures and appearances which
 are but the reflection of their thoughts, and then these are believed to be
 the apparitions of evil spirits or even the spectres of witches. But this is
 contrary to the true faith, which teaches us that certain angels fell from
 heaven and are now devils, and we are bound to acknowledge that by their
 very nature they can do many wonderful things which we cannot do. And those
 who try to induce others to perform such evil wonders are called witches.
 And because infidelity in a person who has been baptized is technically
 called heresy, therefore such persons are plainly heretics.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As regards those who hold the other two errors, those, that is to say, who
 do not deny that there are demons and that demons possess a natural power,
 but who differ among themselves concerning the possible effects of magic and
 the possible operations of witches: the one school holding that a witch can
 truly bring about certain effects, yet these effects are not real but
 phantastical, the other school allowing that some real harm does befall the
 person or persons injured, but that when a witch imagines this damage is the
 effect of her arts she is grossly deceived. This error seems to be based
 upon two passages from the Canons where certain women are condemned who
 falsely imagine that during the night they ride abroad with
 Diana or Herodias. This may read in the Canon. Yet because such things
 often happen by illusion are merely in the imagination, those who suppose
 that all the effects of witchcraft are mere illusion and imagination are very
 greatly deceived. Secondly, with regard to a man who believes or maintains
 that a creature can be made, or changed for better or for worse, or
 transformed into some other kind or likeness by anyone save by God, the
 Creator of all things, alone, is an infidel and worse than a heathen.
 Wherefore on account of these words “changed for the worse” they
 say that such an effect if wrought by witchcraft cannot be real but must be
 purely phantastical.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But inasmuch as these errors savour of heresy and contradict the obvious
 meaning of the Canon, we will first prove our points by the divine law,
 as also by ecclesiastical and civil law, and first in general.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To commence, the expressions of the Canon must be treated of in detail
 (although the sense of the Canon will be even more clearly elucidated in the
 following question). For the divine in many places commands that witches
 are not only to be avoided, but also they are to be put to death, and it
 would not impose the extreme penalty of this kind if witches did not really
 and truly make a compact with devils in order to bring about real and true
 hurts and harms. For the penalty of death is not inflicted except for some
 grave and notorious crime, but it is otherwise with death of the soul, which
 can be brought about by the power of a phantastical illusion or even by the
 stress of temptation. This is the opinion of S. Thomas when he discusses
 whether it be evil to make use of the help of devils (ii. 7). For in the
 18th chapter of
 <i>Deuteronomy</i> it is commanded that all wizards and charmers are to
 be destroyed. Also the 19th chapter of <i>Leviticus</i> says: The soul which goeth to wizards
 and soothsayers to commit fornication with them, I will set my face against
 that soul, and destroy it out of the midst of my people. And again, 20: A man, or
 woman, in whom there is a pythonical or divining spirit dying, let them die:
 they shall stone them. Those persons are said to be pythons in whom the
 devil works extraordinary things.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, this must be borne in mind, that on account of this sin Ochozias
 fell sick and died, IV. <i>Kings I</i>. Also Saul, I <i>Paralipomenon</i>,
 10. We have, moreover, the weighty opinions of the Fathers who have written
 upon the scriptures and who have treated at length of the power of demons
 and of magic arts. The writings of many doctors upon Book 2 of the Sentences
 may be consulted, and it will be found that they all agree, that there are
 wizards and sorcerers who by the power of the devil can produce real and
 extraordinary effects, and these effects are not imaginary, and God permits
 this to be. I will not mention those very many other places where S. Thomas
 in great detail discusses operations of this kind. As, for example, in his
 <i>Summa
 contra Gentiles</i>, Book 3, c. 1 and 2, in part one, question 114,
 argument 4. And in the <i>Second of the Second</i>, questions
 92 and 94. We
 may further consult the Commentators and the Exegetes who have written upon
 the wise men and the magicians of Pharao, <i>Exodus</i> vii. We may also
 consult what S. Augustine says in
 <i>The City of God</i>, Book 18, c. 17.
 See further his second book
 <i>On Christian Doctrine</i>. Very many other
 doctors advance the same opinion, and it would be the height of folly for
 any man to contradict all these, and he could not be held to be clear of the
 guilt of heresy. For any man who gravely errs in an exposition of Holy
 Scripture is rightly considered to be a heretic. And whosoever thinks
 otherwise concerning these matters which touch the faith that the Holy
 Roman Church holds is a heretic. There is the Faith.

<h2>Question II</h2>
<h3>If it be in Accordance with the Catholic Faith to maintain that in Order to bring about some Effect of Magic, the Devil must intimately co-operate with the Witch, or whether one without the other, that is to say, the Devil without the Witch, or conversely, could produce such an Effect.</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 If it be in accordance with the Catholic Faith to maintain that in order to
 bring about some effect of magic, the devil must intimately co-operate with
 the witch, or whether one without the other, that is to say, the devil
 without the witch, or conversely, could produce such an effect.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the first argument is this: That the devil can bring about an effect of
 magic without the co-operation of any witch. So S. Augustine holds. All things
 which visibly happen so that they can be seen, may (it is believed) be the
 work of the inferior powers of the air. But bodily ills and ailments are
 certainly not invisible, nay rather, they are evident to the senses, therefore
 they can be brought about by devils. Moreover, we learn from the Holy
 Scriptures of the disasters which fell upon Job, how fire fell from heaven
 and striking the sheep and the servants consumed them, and how a violent
 wind threw down the four corners of a house so that it fell upon his
 children and slew them all. The devil by himself without the co-operation
 of any witches, but merely by God's permission alone, was able to bring about
 all these disasters. Therefore he can certainly do many things which are
 often ascribed to the work of witches.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this is obvious from the account of the seven husbands of the maiden
 Sara, whom a devil killed. Moreover, whatever a superior power is able to do,
 it is able to do without reference to a power superior to it, and a superior
 power can all the more work without reference to an inferior power. But an
 inferior power can cause hailstorms and bring about diseases without the
 help of a power greater than itself. For Blessed Albertus Magnus in his work
 <i>De passionibus aeris</i> says that rotten sage,
 if used as he explains, and thrown into running water, will arouse most
 fearful tempests and storms.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, it may be said that the devil makes use of a witch, not because he
 has need of any such agent, but because he is seeking the perdition of the
 witch. We may refer to what Aristotle says in the 3rd book of his
 <i>Ethics</i>.
 Evil is a voluntary act which is proved by the fact that nobody performs an
 unjust action, and a man who commits a rape does this for the sake of
 pleasure, not merely doing evil for evil's sake. Yet the law punishes those
 who have done evil as if they had acted merely for the sake of doing evil.
 Therefore if the devil works by means of a witch he is merely employing an
 instrument; and since an instrument depends upon the will of the person who
 employs it and does not act of its own free will, therefore the guilt of the
 action ought not to be laid to the charge of the witch, and in consequence
 she should not be punished.

 <p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But an opposite opinion holds that the devil cannot so easily and readily
 do harm by himself to mankind, as he can harm them through the instrumentality
 of witches, although they are his servants. In the first place we may
 consider the act of generation. But for every act which has an effect upon
 another some kind of contact must be established, and because the devil, who
 is a spirit, can have no such actual contact with a human body, since there
 is nothing common of this kind between them, therefore he uses some human
 instruments, and upon these he bestows the power of hurting by bodily touch.
 And many hold this to be proven by the text, and the gloss upon the text, in
 the
 3rd chapter of S. Paul's Epistle to the <i>Galatians</i>:
 O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the
 truth? And the gloss upon this passage refers to those who have singularly
 fiery and baleful eyes, who by a mere look can harm others, especially
 young children. And Avicenna also bears this out,
 <i>Naturalism</i>, Book 3, c. the last, when he says; “Very often the
 soul may have as much influence upon the body of another to the same extent
 as it has upon its own body, for such is the influence of the eyes of anyone
 who by his glance attracts and fascinates another.” And the same
 opinion is maintained by Al-Gazali in the 5th book and 10th c. of his
 <i>Physics</i>. Avicenna also suggests, although he does not put this opinion
 forward as irrefutable, that the power of the imagination can actually change
 or seem to change extraneous bodies, in cases where the power of the
 imagination is too unrestrained; and hence we father that the power of the
 imagination is not to be considered as distinct from a man's other sensible
 powers, since it is common to them all, but to some extent it includes all
 those other powers. And this is true, because such a power of the imagination
 can change adjacent bodies, as, for example, when a man is able to walk along
 some narrow beam which is stretched down the middle of a street. But yet if
 this beam were suspended over deep water he would not dare to walk along it,
 because his imagination would most strongly impress upon his mind the idea
 of falling, and therefore his body and the power of his limbs would not obey
 his imagination, and they would not obey the contrary thereto, that is to
 say, walking directly and without hesitation. This change may be compared to
 the influence exercised by the eyes of a person who has such influence, and
 so a mental change is brought about although there is not any actual and
 bodily change.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, if it be argued that such a change is cause by a living body owing
 to the influence of the mind upon some other living body, this answer may be
 given. In the presence of a murderer blood flows from the wounds in the
 corpse of the person he has slain. Therefore without any mental powers bodies
 can produce wonderful effects, and so a living man if he pass by near the
 corpse of a murdered man, although he may not be aware of the dead body, is
 often seized with fear.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, there are some things in nature which have certain hidden powers, the
 reason for which man does not know; such, for example, is the lodestone,
 which attracts steel and many other such things, which S. Augustine mentions
 in the 20th book <i>Of the City of God</i>.

 <p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And so women in order to bring about changes in the bodies of others
 sometimes make use of certain things, which exceed our knowledge, but this
 is without any aid from the devil. And because these remedies are mysterious
 we must not therefore ascribe them to the power of the devil as we should
 ascribe evil spells wrought by witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, witches use certain images and other strange periapts, which they
 are wont to place under the lintels of the doors of houses, or in those
 meadows where flocks are herding, or even where men congregate, and thus
 they cast spells over their victims, who have oft-times been known to die.
 But because such extraordinary effects can proceed from these images it
 would appear that the influence of these images is in proportion to the
 influence of the stars over human bodies, for as natural bodies are influenced
 by heavenly bodies, so may artificial bodies likewise be thus influenced.
 But natural bodies may find the benefit of certain secret but good influences.
 Therefore artificial bodies may receive such influence. Hence it is plain
 that those who perform works of healing may well perform them by means of
 such good influences, and this has no connexion at all with any evil power.

 <p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, it would seem that most extraordinary and miraculous events come
 to pass by the working of the power of nature. For wonderful and terrible
 and amazing things happen owing to natural forces. And this S. Gregory points
 out in his <i>Second Dialogue</i>. The Saints
 perform miracles, sometimes by a prayer, sometimes by their power alone.
 There are examples of each; S. Peter by praying raised
 to life Tabitha, who was dead. By rebuking Ananias and Sapphira, who
 were telling a lie, he slew the without any prayer. Therefore a man by his
 mental influence can change a material body into another, or he can change
 such a body from health to sickness and conversely.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, the human body is nobler than any other body, but because of the
 passions of the mind the human body changes and becomes hot or cold, as is
 the case with angry men or men who are afraid: and so even greater change
 takes place with regard to the effects of sickness and death, which by their
 power can greatly change a material body.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But certain objections must be allowed. The influence of the mind cannot make
 an impression upon any form except by the intervention of some agent, as we
 have said above. And these are the words of S. Augustine in the book which we
 have already quoted: It is incredible that the angels who fell from Heaven
 should be obedient to any material things, for the obey God only. And much
 less can a man of his natural power bring about extraordinary and evil
 effects. The answer must be made, there are even to-day many who err greatly
 on this point, making excuses for witches and laying the whole blame upon
 the craft of the devil, or ascribing the changes that they work to some
 natural alteration. These errors may be easily made clear. First, by the
 description of witches which S. Isidore gives in his
 <i>Etymologiae</i>, c. 9: Witches are so called on account of the
 blackness of their guilt, that is to say, their deeds are more evil than
 those of any other malefactors. He continues: They stir up and confound the
 elements by the aid of the devil, and arouse terrible hailstorms and
 tempests. Moreover, he says they distract the minds of men, driving them to
 madness, insane hatred, and inordinate lusts. Again, he continues, by the
 terrible influence of their spells alone, as it were by a draught of poison,
 they can destroy life.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the words of S. Augustine in his book on <i>The City of God</i>
 are very much to the point, for he tells us
 who magicians and witches really are. Magicians, who are commonly called
 witches, are thus termed on account of the magnitude of their evil deeds.
 These are they who by the permission of God disturb the elements, who drive
 to distraction the minds of men, such as have lost their trust in God, and
 by the terrible power of their evil spells, without any actual draught or
 poison, kill human beings. As Lucan says: A mind which has not been corrupted
 by any noxious drink perishes forspoken by some evil charm. For having
 summoned devils to their aid they actually dare to heap harms upon mankind,
 and even to destroy their enemies by their evil spells. And it is certain
 that in operations of this kind the witch works in close conjunction with
 the devil. Secondly, punishments are of four kinds: beneficial, hurtful,
 wrought by witchcraft, and natural. Beneficial punishments are meted out by
 the ministry of good Angels, just as hurtful punishments proceed from evil
 spirits. Moses smote Egypt with ten plagues by the ministry of good Angels,
 and the magicians were only able to perform three of these miracles by the
 aid of the devil. And the pestilence which fell upon the people for three
 days because of the sin of David who numbered the people, and the 72,000
 men who were slain in one night in the army of Sennacherib, were miracles
 wrought by the Angels of God, that is, by good Angels who feared God and
 knew that they were carrying out His commands.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Destructive harm, however, is wrought by the medium of bad angels, at whose
 hands the children of Israel in the desert were often afflicted. And those
 harms which are simply evil and nothing more are brought about by the devil,
 who works through the medium of sorcerers and witches. There are also
 natural harms which in some manner depend upon the conjunction of heavenly
 bodies, such as dearth, drought, tempests, and similar effects of nature.

 <p>
  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is obvious that there is a vast difference between all these causes,
 circumstances, and happenings. For Job was afflicted by the devil with a
 harmful disease, but this is nothing to the purpose. And if anybody who is
 too clever and over-curious asks how it was that Job was afflicted with this
 disease by the devil without the aid of some sorcerer or witch, let him know
 that he is merely beating the air and not informing himself as to the real
 truth. For in the time of Job there were no sorcerers and witches, and such
 abominations were not yet practised. But the providence of God wished that
 by the example of Job the power of the devil even over good men might be
 manifested, so that we might learn to be on our guard against Satan, and,
 moreover, by the example of this holy patriarch the glory of God shines
 abroad, since nothing happens save what is permitted by God.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question III</h2>
<h3>Whether Children can be Generated by Incubi and Succubi.</h3></div>



  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 At first it may truly seem that it is not in accordance with the Catholic
 Faith to maintain that children can be begotten by devils, that is to say,
 by Incubi and Succubi: for God Himself, before
 sin came into the world, instituted human procreation, since He created
 woman from the rib of man to be a helpmeet unto man: And to them He said:
 Increase, and multiply,
 <i>Genesis</i> ii, 24. Likewise after sin had come
 into the world, it was said to Noe: Increase, and multiply,
 <i>Genesis</i> ix, 1. In the time of the new law also, Christ confirmed
 this union: Have ye not read, that he who made man from the beginning,
 <i>Made them male and female?</i> S.
 <i>Matthew</i> xix, 4. Therefore, men cannot be begotten in any other
 way than this.<p>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be argued that devils take their part in this generation not as
 the essential cause, but as a secondary and artificial cause, since they
 busy themselves by interfering with the process of normal copulation and
 conception, by obtaining human semen, and themselves transferring it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Objection</i>. The devil can perform this act in every state of life,
 that is to say, in the matrimonial state, or not in the matrimonial state.
 Now he cannot perform it in the first state, because then the act of the
 devil would be more powerful than the act of God, Who instituted and
 confirmed this holy estate, since it is a state of continence and wedlock.
 Nor can he effect this in any other estate: since we never read in Scripture
 that children can be begotten in one state and not in another.<p>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, to beget a child is the act of a living body, but devils cannot
 bestow life upon the bodies which they assume; because life formally only
 proceeds from the soul, and the act of generation is the act of the physical
 organs which have bodily life. Therefore bodies which are assumed in this
 way cannot either beget or bear.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Yet it may be said that these devils assume a body not in order that they
 may bestow life upon it, but that they may by the means of this body preserve
 human semen, and pass the semen on to another body.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Objection</i>. As in the action of angels, whether they be good or bad,
 there is nothing superfluous and useless, nor is there anything superfluous
 and useless in nature. But the devil by his natural power, which is far
 greater than any human bodily power, can perform any spiritual action, and
 perform it again and again although man may not be able to discern it.
 Therefore he is able to perform this action, although man may not be able to
 discern when the devil is concerned therewith. For all bodily and material
 things are on a lower scale than pure and spiritual intelligences. But the
 angels, whether they be good or whether they be evil, are pure and spiritual
 intelligences. Therefore they can control what is below them. Therefore the
 devil can collect and make use as he will of human semen which belongs to
 the body.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 However, to collect human semen from one person and to transfer it to another
 implies certain local actions. But devils cannot locally move bodies from
 place to place. And this is the argument they put forward. The soul is
 purely a spiritual essence, so is the devil: but the soul cannot move a
 body from place to place except it be that body in which it lives and to
 which it gives life: whence if any member of the body perishes it becomes
 dead and immovable. Therefore devils cannot move a body from place to place,
 except it be a body to which they give life. It has been shown, however, and
 is acknowledged that devils do not bestow life on anybody, therefore they
 cannot move human semen locally, that is, from place to place, from body to
 body.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, every action is performed by contact, and especially the act of
 generation. But it does not seem possible that there can be any contact
 between the demon and human bodies, since he has not actual point of contact
 with them. Therefore he cannot inject semen into a human body, and therefore
 since this needs a certain bodily action, it would seem that the devil
 cannot accomplish it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, devils have no power to move those bodies which in a natural order
 are more closely related to them, for example the heavenly bodies, therefore
 they have no power to move those bodies which are more distant and distinct
 from them. The major is proved, since the power that moves and the movement
 are one and the same thing according to Aristotle in his
 <i>Physics</i>. It follows, therefore, that devils
 who move heavenly bodies must be in heaven, which is wholly untrue, both in
 our opinion, and in the opinion of the Platonists.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, S. Augustine, <i>On the Trinity</i>, III,
 says that devils do indeed collect human semen, by means of which they are
 able to produce bodily effects; but this cannot be done without some local
 movement, therefore demons can transfer semen which they have collected and
 inject it into the bodies of others. But, as Walafrid Strabo says in his
 commentary upon <i>Exodus</i> vii, II: And Pharao
 called the wise men and the magicians: Devils go about the earth collecting
 every sort of seed, and can by working upon them broadcast various species.
 See also the gloss on those words (Pharao called). And again in
 <i>Genesis</i> vi
 the gloss makes two comments on the words: And the sons of God saw the
 daughters of men. First, that by the sons of God are meant the sons of Seth,
 and by the daughters of men, the daughters of Cain. Second, that Giants
 were created not by some incredibly act of men, but by certain devils, which
 are shameless towards women. For the Bible says, Giants were upon the earth.
 Moreover, even after the Flood the bodies not only of men, but also of women,
 were pre-eminently and incredibly beautiful.<p>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. For the sake of brevity much concerning the power of the devil
 and his works in the matter of the effects of witchcraft is left out; for
 the pious reader either accepts it as proved, or he may, if he wish to
 inquire, find every point clearly elucidated in the second <i>Book of
 Sentences</i>, 5. For hw will see that the devils perform all their works
 consciously and voluntarily; for the nature that was given them has not been
 changed. See Dionysius in his fourth chapter on the
 subject; their nature remained intact and very splendid, although they
 cannot use it for any good purpose.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as to their intelligence, he will find that they excel in three points
 of understanding, in their age-long experience, and in the revelation of the
 higher spirits. He will find also how, through the influence of the stars,
 they learn the dominating characteristics of men, and so discover that some
 are more disposed to work witchcraft that others, and that they molest
 these chiefly for the purpose of such works.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as to their will, the reader will find that it cleaves unchangeably to
 evil, and that they continuously sin in pride, envy, and gross covetousness;
 and that God, for his own glory, permits them to work against His will. He
 will also understand how with these two qualities of intellect and will
 devils do marvels, so that there is no power in earth which can be compared
 to them: <i>Job xli</i>.
 There is no power on the earth which can be compared with him, who was created
 that he should fear no one. But here the gloss says, Although he fears no
 one he is yet subject to the merits of the Saints.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 He will find also how the devil knows the thoughts of our hearts; how he can
 substantially and disastrously metamorphose bodies with the help of an agent;
 how he can move bodies locally, and alter the outward and inner feelings to
 every conceivable extent; and how he can change the intellect and will of a
 man, however indirectly.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For although all this is pertinent to our present inquiry, we wish only to
 draw some conclusion therefrom as to that nature of devils, and so proceed
 to the discussion of our question.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the Theologians have ascribed to them certain qualities, as that they
 are unclean spirits, yet not by very nature unclean. For according to
 Dionysius there is in them a natural madness, a rabid concupiscence, a wanton
 fancy, as is seen from their spiritual sins of pride, envy, and wrath. For
 this reason they are the enemies of the human race: rational in mind, but
 reasoning without words; subtle in wickedness, eager to hurt; ever fertile
 in fresh deceptions, they change the perceptions and befoul the emotions of
 men, they confound the watchful, and in dreams disturb the sleeping; they
 bring diseases, stir up tempests, disguise themselves as angels of light,
 bear Hell always about them; from witches they usurp to themselves the
 worship of God, and by this means magic spells are made; they seek to get a
 mastery over the good, and molest them to the most of their power; to the
 elect they are given as a temptation, and always they lie in wait for the
 destruction of men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And although they have a thousand ways of doing harm, and have tried ever
 since their downfall to bring about schisms in the Church, to disable
 charity, to infect with the gall of envy the sweetness of the acts of the
 Saints, and in every way to subvert and perturb the human race; yet their
 power remains confined to the privy parts and the navel. See
 <i>Job</i> xli.
 For through the wantonness of the flesh they have much power over men; and
 in men the source of wantonness lies in the privy parts, since it is from
 them that the semen falls, just as in women it falls from the navel.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 These things, then, being granted for a proper understanding of the question
 of Incubi and Succubi, it must be said that it is just as Catholic a view
 to hold that men may at times be begotten by means of Incubi and Succubi, as
 it is contrary to the words of the Saints and even to the tradition of Holy
 Scripture to maintain the opposite opinion. And this is proved as follows.
 S. Augustine in one place raises this question, not indeed as regards
 witches, but with reference to the very works of devils, and to the fables
 of the poets, and leave the matter in some doubt; though later on he is
 definite in the matter of Holy Scripture. For in his
 <i>De Ciuitate Dei</i>, Book 3, chapter 2, he says:
 We leave open the question  whether it was possible for Venus to give birth
 to Aeneas through coition with Anchises. For a similar question arises in
 the Scriptures, where it is asked whether evil angels lay with the daughters
 of men, and thereby the earth was then filled with giants, that is to say,
 preternaturally big and strong men. But he settles the question in
 Book 5, chapter 23,
 in these words: It is a very general belief, the truth of which is vouched
 for by many from their own experience, or at least from heresay as having
 been experienced by men of undoubted trustworthiness, that Satyrs and Fauns
 (which are commonly called Incubi) have appeared to wanton women and have
 sought and obtained coition with them. And that certain devils (which the
 Gauls call Dusii) assiduously attempt and achieve this filthiness is vouched
 for by so many credible witness that it would seem impudent to deny it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Later in the same book he settles the second contention, namely, that the
 passage in Genesis about the sons of God (that is Seth) and the daughters
 of men (that is Cain) does not speak only of Incubi, since the existence of
 such is not credible. In this connexion there is the gloss which we have
 touched upon before. He says that it is not outside belief that the Giants
 of whom the Scripture speaks were begotten not by men, but by Angels or
 certain devils who lust after women. To the same effect is the gloss in
 <i>Esaias</i> xiii, where the prophet foretells
 the desolation of Babylon, and the monsters that should inhabit it. He says:
 Owls shall dwell there, and Satyrs shall dance there. By Satyrs here devils
 are meant; as the gloss says, Satyrs are wild shaggy creatures of the woods,
 which are a certain kind of devils called Incubi. And again in
 <i>Esaias</i> xxxiv,
 where he prophesies the desolation of the land of the Idumeans because they
 persecuted the Jews, he says: And it shall be an habitation of dragons, and
 a court for owls. The wild beasts also of the desert shall meet . . . The
 interlinear gloss interprets this as monsters and devils. And in the same
 place Blessed Gregory explains these to be woodland gods under another name,
 not those which the Greeks called Pans, and the Latins Incubi.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Similarly Blessed Isidore, in the last chapter of his 8th book, says: Satyrs
 are they who are called Pans in Greek and Incubi in Latin. And they are
 called Incubi from their practice of overlaying,
 that is debauching. For they often lust lecherously after women, and
 copulate with them; and the Gauls name them Dusii,
 because they are diligent in this beastliness. But the devil which the
 common people call an Incubus, the Romans called
 a fig Faun; to which Horace said, “O Faunus,
 love of fleeing nymphs, go gently over my lands and smiling fields.”<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question IV</h2>
<h3>By which Devils are the Operations of Incubus and Succubus Practised?</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Is it Catholic to affirm that the functions of Incubi and Succubi belong
 indifferently and equally to all unclean spirits? <i>And it seems</i> that
 it is so; for to affirm the opposite would be to maintain that there is some
 good order among them. It is argued that just as in the computation of the
 Good there are degrees and orders (see S. Augustine in his book on
 the nature of the Good),
 so also the computation of the Evil is based upon confusion. But as among
 the good Angels nothing can be without order, so among the bad all is
 disorder, and therefore they all indifferently follows these practices. See
 <i>Job x.</i>: A land of darkness, as darkness
 itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light
 is as darkness.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, if they do not all indifferently follow these practices, this quality
 in them comes either from their nature, or from sin, or from punishment. But
 it does not come from their nature, since they are all without distinction
 given to sin, as was set out in the preceding question. For they are by
 nature impure spirits, yet not so unclean as to pejorate their good parts;
 subtle in wickedness, eager to do harm, swollen with pride, etc. Therefore
 these practices in them are due either to sin or to punishment. Then again,
 where the sin is greater, there is the punishment greater; and the higher
 angels sinned more greatly, therefore their punishment they have the more to
 follow these filthy practices. If this is not so, another reason will be
 given why they do not indifferently practise these things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again, it is argued that where there is no discipline or obedience,
 there all work without distinction; and it is submitted that there is no
 discipline or obedience among devils, and no agreement.
 <i>Proverbs</i> xiii.: Among the proud there is
 always contention.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, just as because of sin they will all equally be case into Hell after
 the Day of Judgement, so before that time they are detained in the lower
 mists on account of the duties assigned to them. We do not read that there
 is equality on account of emancipation, therefore neither is there equality
 in the matter of duty and temptation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But <i>against</i> this there is the first gloss on
 I <i>Corinthians</i> xv: As long as the world
 endures Angels are set over Angels, men over men, and devils over devils.
 Also in <i>Job</i> xl
 it speaks of the scales of Leviathan, which signify the members of the devil,
 how one cleaves to another. Therefore there is among them diversity both of
 order and of action.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Another question arises, whether or not the devils can be restrained by the
 good Angels from pursuing these foul practices. It must be said that the
 Angels to whose command the adverse Influences are subject are called
 Powers, as S. Gregory says, and S. Augustine
 (<i>de Trinitate</i>, 3). A rebellious and sinful
 spirit of life is subject to an obedient, pious and just spirit of life.
 And those Creatures which are more perfect and nearer to God have authority
 over the others: for the whole order of preference is originally and in the
 first place in God, and is shared by His creatures according as they approach
 more nearly to Him. Therefore the good Angels, who are nearest to God on
 account of their fruition in Him, which the devils lack, have preference
 over the devils, and rule over them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And when it is urged that devils work much harm without any medium, or that
 they are not hindered because they are not subject to good Angels who might
 prevent them; or that if they are so subject, then the evil that is done by
 the subject is due to negligence on the part of the master, and there seems
 to be some negligence among the good Angels: the answer is that the Angels
 are ministers of the Divine wisdom. It follows then that, as the Divine
 wisdom permits certain evil to be done by bad Angels or men, for the sake of
 the good that He draws therefrom, so also the good Angels do not altogether
 prevent wicked men or devils from doing evil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. It is Catholic to maintain that there is a certain order of
 interior and exterior actions, and a degree of preference among devils.
 Whence it follows that certain abominations are committed by the lowest
 orders, from which the higher orders are precluded on account of the
 nobility of their natures. And this is generally said to arise from a
 threefold congruity, in that such things harmonize with their nature, with
 the Divine wisdom, and with their own wickedness.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But more particularly as touching their nature. It is agreed that from the
 beginning of Creation some were always by nature superior, since they differ
 among themselves as to form; and no two Angels are alike in form. This
 follows the more general opinion, which also agrees with the words of the
 Philosophers. Dionysus also lays it down in his tenth chapter
 <i>On the Celestial Hierarchy</i>
 that in the same order there are three separate degrees; and we must agree
 with this, since they are both immaterial and incorporeal. See also
 S. Thomas (ii. 2).
 For sin does not take away their nature, and the devils after the Fall did
 not lose their natural gifts, as has been said before; and the operations
 of things follow their natural conditions. Therefore both in nature and in
 operation they are various and multiple.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This harmonizes also with the Divine wisdom; for that which is ordained is
 ordained by God
 (<i>Romans</i> xiii).
 And since devils were deputed by God for the temptation of men and the
 punishment of the damned, therefore they work upon men from without by many
 and various means.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It harmonizes also with their own wickedness. For since they are at war with
 the human race, they fight in an orderly manner; for so they think to do
 greater harm to men, and so they do. Whence it follows that they do not
 share in an equal manner in their most unspeakable abominations.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this is more specifically proved as follows. For since, as has been said,
 the operation follows the nature of the thing, it follows also that those
 whose natures are subordinate must in turn be subordinate to themselves in
 operation, just as is the case in corporeal matters. For since the lower
 bodies are by natural ordination below the celestial bodies, and their
 actions and motions are subject to the actions and motions of the celestial
 bodies; and since the devils, as has been said, differ among themselves in
 natural order; therefore they also differ among themselves in their natural
 actions, both extrinsic and instrinsic, and especially in the performance of
 the abominations in question.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From which it is concluded that since the practice of these abominations is
 for the most part foreign to the nobility of the angelic nature, so also in
 human actions the foulest and beastliest acts are to be considered by
 themselves, and not in relation to the duty of human nature and procreation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Finally, since some are believed to have fallen from every order, it is not
 unsuitable to maintain that those devils who fell from the lowest choir, and
 even in that held the lowest rank, are deputed to and perform these and
 other abominations.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also it must be carefully noted that, though the Scripture speaks of Incubi
 and Succubi lusting after women, yet nowhere do we read that Incubi and
 Succubi fell into vices against nature. We do not speak only of sodomy, but
 of any other sin whereby the act is wrongfully performed outside the
 rightful channel. And the very great enormity of such as sin in this way is
 shown by the fact that all devils equally, of whatsoever order, abominate
 and think shame to commit such actions. And it seems that the gloss on
 <i>Ezekiel</i> xix
 means this, where it says: I will give thee into the hands of the dwellers
 in Palestine, that is devils, who shall blush at your iniquities, meaning
 vices against nature. And the student will see what should be
 authoritatively understood concerning devils. For no sin has God so often
 punished by the shameful death of multitudes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Indeed many say, and it is truly believed, that no one can unimperilled
 persevere in the practice of such vices beyond the period of the mortal life
 of Christ, which lasted for thirty-three years, unless he should be saved by
 some special grace of the Redeemer. And this is proved by the fact that
 there have often been ensnared by this vice octogenarians and centenarians,
 who had up to that time ruled their lives according to the discipline of
 Christ; and, having forsaken Him, they have found the very greatest
 difficulty in obtaining deliverance, and in abandoning themselves to such
 vices.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, the names of the devils indicate what order there is among them,
 and what office is assigned to each. For though one and the same name, that
 of devil, is generally used in Scripture because of their various qualities,
 yet the Scriptures teach that One is set over these filthy actions, just as
 certain other vices are subject to Another. For it is the practice of
 Scripture and of speech to name every unclean spirit Diabolus, from Dia,
 that is Two, and Bolus, that is Morsel; for he kills two thing, the body and
 the soul. And this is in accordance with etymology, although in Greek
 <i>Diabolus</i> means shut in Prison, which also is apt, since he is not
 permitted to do as much harm as he wishes. Or Diabolus may mean Downflowing,
 since he flowed down, that is, fell down, both specifically and locally. He
 is also named Demon, that is, Cunning over Blood, since he thirsts for and
 procures sin with a threefold knowledge, being powerful in the subtlety of
 his nature, in his age-long experience, and in the revelation of the good
 spirits. He is called also Belial, which means Without Yoke or Master; for
 he can fight against him to whom he should be subject. He is called also
 Beelzebub, which means Lord of Flies, that is, of the souls of sinners who
 have left the true faith of Christ. Also Satan, that is, the Adversary; see
 I <i>S. Peter</i> ii: For your adversary the devil
 goeth about, etc. Also Behemoth, that is, Beast, because he makes men bestial.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the very devil of Fornication, and the chief of that abomination, is
 called Asmodeus, which means the Creature of Judgement: for because of this
 kind of sin a terrible judgement was executed upon Sodom and the four other
 cities. Similarly the devil of Pride is called Leviathan, which means Their
 Addition; because when Lucifer tempted our first parents he promised them,
 out of his pride, the addition of Divinity. Concerning him the Lord said
 through Esaias: I shall visit it upon Leviathan, that old and tortuous
 serpent. And the devil of Avarice and Riches is called Mammon, whom also
 Christ mentions in the Gospel
 (<i>S. Matthew</i> vi): Ye cannot serve God, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To the arguments. <i>First</i>, that good can be found without evil, but
 evil cannot be found without good; for it is poured upon a creature that is
 good in itself. And therefore the devils, in so far as they have a good
 nature, were ordained in the course of nature; and for their actions see
 <i>Job</i> x.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Secondly</i>, it can be said that the devils deputed to work are not in
 Hell, but in the lower mists. And they have here an order among themselves,
 which they will not have in Hell. From which it may be said that all order
 ceased among them, as touching the attainment of blessedness, at that time
 when they fell irrecoverably from such rank. And it may be said that even in
 Hell there will be among them a gradation of power, and of the affliction of
 punishments, inasmuch as some, and not others, will be deputed to torment the
 souls. But this gradation will come rather from God than from themselves, as
 will also their torments.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Thirdly</i>, when it is said that the higher devils, because they sinned
 the more, are the more punished, and must therefore be the more bound to the
 commission of these filthy acts, it is answered that sin bears relation to
 punishment, and not to the act or operation of nature; and therefore it is
 by reason of their nobility of nature that these are not given to such
 filthiness, and it has nothing to do with their sin or punishment. And
 though they are all impure spirits, and eager to do harm, yet one is more
 so than another, in proportion as their natures are the further thrust into
 darkness.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Fourthly</i>, it is said that there is agreement among devils, but of
 wickedness rather than friendship, in that they hate mankind, and strive
 their utmost against justice. For such agreement is found among the wicked,
 that they band themselves together, and depute those whose talents seem
 suitable to the pursuit of particular iniquities.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Fifthly</i>, although imprisonment is equally decreed for all, now in the
 lower atmosphere and afterwards in Hell, yet not therefore are equal
 penalties and duties equally ordained for them: for the nobler they are in
 nature and the more potent in office, the heavier is the torment to which
 they are subjected. See
 <i>Wisdom</i> vi:
 “The powerful shall powerfully suffer torments.”

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question V</h2>
<h3>What is the Source of the Increase of Works of Witchcraft? Whence comes it that the Practice of Witchcraft hath so notably increased?</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Is it in any way a Catholic opinion to hold that the origin and growth of
 witchcraft proceed from the influence of the celestial bodies; or from the
 abundant wickedness of men, and not from the abominations of Incubi and
 Succubi? And it seems that it springs from man's own wickedness. For S.
 Augustine says, in Book LXXXIII, that the cause of a man's depravity lies
 in his own will, whether he sins at his own or at another's suggestion. But
 a witch is depraved through sin, therefore the cause of it is not the devil
 but human will. In the same place he speaks of free-will, that everyone is
 the cause of his own wickedness. And he reasons thus: that the sin of man
 proceeds from free-will, but the devil cannot destroy free-will, for this
 would militate against liberty: therefore the devil cannot be the cause of
 that or any other sin. Again, in the book of Ecclesiastic Dogma it is said:
 Not all our evil thoughts are stirred up by the devil, but sometimes they
 arise from the operation of our own judgement.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, if the stars were not the cause of human actions both good and bad,
 Astrologers would not so frequently foretell the truth about the result of
 wars and other human acts: therefore they are in some way a cause.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, the stars influence the devils themselves in the causing of certain
 spells; and therefore they can all the more influence men. Three proofs are
 adduced for this assumption. For certain men who are called Lunatics are
 molested by devils more at one time than at another; and the devils would
 not so behave, but would rather molest them at all times, unless they
 themselves were deeply affected by certain phases of the Moon. It is proved
 again from the fact the Necromancers observe certain constellations for the
 invoking of devils, which they would not do unless they knew that those
 devils were subject to the stars.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this is also adduced as a proof; that according to S. Augustine (<i>de
 Ciuitate Dei</i>, 10), the devils employ certain lower bodies, such as herbs,
 stones, animals, and certain sounds and voices, and figures. But since the
 heavenly bodies are of more potency than the lower bodies, therefore the
 stars are a far greater influence than these things. And witches are the
 more in subjection in that their deeds proceed from the influence of those
 bodies, and not from the help of evil spirits. And the argument is supported
 from I <i>Kings</i> xvi, where Saul was vexed by a devil, but was calmed
 when David struck his harp before him, and the evil departed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>But against this</i>. It is impossible to produce an effect without its
 cause; and the deeds of witches are such that they cannot be done without
 the help of devils, as is shown by the description of witches in S. Isidore,
 <i>Ethics</i> VIII. WItches are so called from the enormity of their magic
 spells; for they disturb the elements and confound the minds of men, and
 without any venomous draught, but merely by virtue of incantations, destroy
 souls, etc. But this sort of effects cannot be caused by the influence of
 the stars through the agency of a man.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, Aristotle says in his <i>Ethics</i> that it is difficult to know
 what is the beginning of the operation of thought, and shows that it must
 be something extrinsic. For everything that begins from a beginning has some
 cause. Now a man begins to do that which he wills; and he begins to will
 because of some pre-suggestion; and if this is some precedent suggestion, it
 must either proceed from the infinite, or there is some extrinsic beginning
 which first brings a suggestion to a man. Unless indeed it be argued that
 this is a matter of chance, from which it would follow that all human
 actions are fortuitous, which is absurd. Therefore the beginning of good in
 the good is said to be God, Who is not the cause of sin. But for the wicked,
 when a man begins to be influenced towards and wills to commit sin, there
 must also be some extrinsic cause of this. And this can be no other than the
 devil; especially in the case of witches, as is shown above, for the stars
 cannot influence such acts. Therefore the truth is plain.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover, that which has power over the motive has also power over the
 result which is caused by the motive. Now the motive of the will is something
 perceived through the sense or the intellect, both of which are subject to
 the power of the devil. For S. Augustine says in Book 83: This evil, which
 is of the devil, creeps in by all the sensual approaches; he places himself
 in figures, he adapts himself to colours, he attaches himself to sounds, he
 lurks in angry and wrongful conversation, he abides in smells, he impregnates
 with flavours and fills with certain exhalations all the channels of the
 understanding. Therefore it is seen that it is in the devil's power to
 influence the will, which is directly the cause of sin.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, everything which has a choice of two ways needs some determining
 factor before it proceeds to the action. And the free-will of man has the
 choice between good and ill; therefore when he embarks upon sin, it needs
 that he is determined by something towards ill. And this seems chiefly to
 be done by the devil, especially in the actions of witches, whose will is
 made up for evil. Therefore it seems that the evil will of the devil is the
 cause of evil will in man, especially in witches. And the argument may be
 substantiated thus; that just as a good Angel cleaves to good, so does a
 bad Angel to evil; but the former leads a man into goodness, therefore the
 latter leads him into evil. For it is, says Dionysius, the unalterable and
 fixed law of divinity, that the lowest has it cause in the highest.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. Such as contend that witchcraft has its origin in the
 influence of the stars stand convicted of three errors. In the first place,
 it is not possible that it originated from astromancers and casters of
 horoscopes and fortune-tellers. For if it is asked whether the vice of
 witchcraft in men is caused by the influence of the stars, then, in
 consideration of the variety of men's characters, and for the upholding
 of the true faith, a distinction must be maintained; namely, that there are
 two ways in which it can be understood that men's characters can be caused
 by the stars. Either completely and of necessity, or by disposition and
 contingency. And as for the first, it is not only false, but so heretical
 and contrary to the Christian religion, that the true faith cannot be
 maintained in such an error. For this reason, he who argues that everything
 of necessity proceeds from the stars takes away all merit and, in
 consequence, all blame: also he takes away Grace, and therefore Glory.
 For uprightness of character suffers prejudice by this error, since the
 blame of the sinner redounds upon the stars, licence to sin without
 culpability is conceded, and man is committed to the worship and adoration
 of the stars.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But as for the contention that men's characters are conditionally varied by
 the disposition of the stars, it is so far true that is it not contrary to
 reason or faith. For it is obvious that the disposition of a body variously
 causes many variations in the humours and character of the soul; for
 generally the soul imitates the complexions of the body, as it said in the
 Six Principles. Wherefore the choleric are wrathful, the sanguine are kindly,
 the melancholy are envious, and the phlegmatic are slothful. But this is
 not absolute; for the soul is master of its body, especially when it is
 helped by Grace. And we see many choleric who are gently, and melancholy
 who are kindly. Therefore when the virtue of the stars influences the
 formation and quality of a man's humours, it is agreed that they have some
 influence over the character, but very distantly: for the virtue of the
 lower nature has more effect on the quality of the humours than has the
 virtue of the stars.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore S. Augustine (<i>de Ciuitate Dei</i>, V), where he resolves a
 certain question of two brothers who fell ill and were cured simultaneously,
 approves the reasoning of Hippocrates rather than that of an Astronomer.
 For Hippocrates answered that it is owing to the similarity of their humours;
 and the Astronomer answered that it was owing the identity of their
 horoscopes. For the Physician's answer was better, since he adduced the more
 powerful and immediate cause. Thus, therefore, it must be said that the
 influence of the stars is to some degree conducive to the wickedness of
 witches, if it be granted that there is any such influence over the bodies
 that predisposes them to this manner of abomination rather than to any
 other sort of works either vicious or virtuous: but this disposition must
 not be said to be necessary, immediate, and sufficient, but remote and
 contingent.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Neither is that objection valid which is based on the book of the
 Philosophers on the properties of the elements, where it says that kingdoms
 are emptied and lands depopulated at the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn;
 and it is argued from this that such things are to be understood as being
 outside the free-will of men, and that therefore the influence of the stars
 has power over free-will. For it is answered that in this saying the
 Philosopher does not mean to imply that men cannot resist the influence of
 that constellation towards dissensions, but that they will not. For Ptolemy
 in <i>Almagest</i> says:
 A wise man will be the master of the stars.
 For although, since Saturn has a melancholy and bad influence and Jupiter a
 very good influence, the conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn can dispose men to
 quarrels and discords; yet, through free-will, men can resist that
 inclination, and very easily with the help of God's grace.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again it is no valid objection to quote
 S. John Damascene where he says (Book II,
 chap. vi) that comets are often the sign of the death of kings. For it will
 be answered that even if we follow the opinion of S. John Damascene, which
 was, as is evident in the book referred to, contrary to the opinion of the
 Philosophic Way, yet this is no proof of the inevitability of human actions.
 For S. John considers that a comet is not a natural creation, nor is it one
 of the stars set in the firmament; wherefore neither its significance nor
 influence is natural. For he says that comets are not of the stars which
 were created in the beginning, but that they are made for a particular
 occasion, and then dissolved, by Divine command. This then is the opinion
 of S. John Damascene. But God by such a sign foretells the death of kings
 rather than of other men, both because from this may arise the confusion of
 a kingdom. And the Angels are more careful to watch over kings for the
 general good; and kings are born and die under the ministry of Angels.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there is no difficulty in the opinion of the Philosophers, who say that
 a comet is a hot and dry conglomeration, generated in the higher part of
 space near the fire, and that a conjoined globe of that hot and dry vapour
 assumes the likeness of a star. But unincorporated parts of that vapour
 stretch in long extremities joined to that globe, and are a sort of adjunct
 to it. And according to this view, not of itself but by accident, it predicts
 death which proceeds from hot and dry infirmities. And since for the most
 part the rich are fed on things of a hot and dry nature, therefore at such
 times many of the rich die; among which the death of kings and princes is
 the most notable. And this view is not far from the view of S. John
 Damascene, when carefully considered, except as regards the operation and
 co-operation of the Angels, which not even the philosophers can ignore. For
 indeed when the vapours in their dryness and heat have nothing to do with
 the generation of a comet, even then, for reasons already set out, a comet
 may be formed by the operation of an Angel.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In this way the star which portended the death of the learned S. Thomas was
 not one of the stars set in the firmament, but was formed by an Angel from
 some convenient material, and, having performed it office, was again
 dissolved.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this we see that, whichever of those opinions we follow, the stars have
 no inherent influence over the free-will, or, consequently, over the malice
 and character of men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is to be noted also that Astronomers often foretell the truth, and that
 their judgements are for the most part effective on one province or one
 nation. And the reason is that they take their judgements from the stars,
 which, according to the more probable view, have a greater, though not an
 inevitable, influence over the actions of mankind in general, that is, over
 one nation or province, than over one individual person; and this because
 the greater part of one nation more closely obeys the natural disposition
 of the body than does one single man. But this is mentioned incidentally.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the second of the three ways by which we vindicate the Catholic
 standpoint is by refuting the errors of those who cast Horoscopes and
 Mathematicians who worship the goddess of
 fortune. Of these S. Isidore (<i>Ethics</i>, VIII. 9) says that those who
 cast Horoscopes are so called from their examination of the stars at
 nativity, and are commonly called Mathematicians; and in the same Book,
 chapter 2, he says that Fortune has her name from fortuitousness. and is a
 sort of goddess who mocks human affairs in a haphazard and fortuitous manner.
 Wherefore she is called blind, since she runs here and there with no
 consideration for desert, and comes indifferently to good and bad. So much
 for Isidore. But to believe that there is such a goddess, or that the harm
 done to bodies and creatures which is ascribed to witchcraft does not
 actually proceed from witchcraft, but from that same goddess of Fortune,
 is sheer idolatry: and also to assert that witches themselves were born for
 that very purpose that they might perform such deeds in the world is
 similarly alien to the Faith, and indeed to the general teaching of the
 Philosophers. Anyone who pleases may refer to S. Thomas in the 3rd book of
 his <i>Summa</i> of the Faith against the Gentiles. question 87, etc., and
 he will find much to this effect.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Nevertheless one point must not be omitted, for the sake of those who
 perhaps have not great quantity of books. It is there noted that three things
 are to be considered in man, which are directed by three celestial causes,
 namely, the act of the will, the act of the intellect, and the act of the
 body. The first of these is governed directly and soley by God, the second
 by an Angel, and the third by a celestial body. For choice and will are
 directly governed by God for good works, as the Scripture says in
 <i>Proverbs</i> xxi: The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord; he
 turneth it whithersoever he will. And it says “the heart of the king”
 to signify that, as the great cannot oppose His will, so are others even
 less able to do so. Also S. Paul says: God who causeth us to wish and to
 perform that which is good.<br/>

<h2>Question VI</h2>
<h3>Concerning Witches who copulate with Devils. Why is it that Women are chiefly addicted to Evil superstitions?</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is also, concerning witches who copulate with devils, much difficulty
 in considering the methods by which such abominations are consummated. On
 the part of the devil: first, of what element the body is made that he
 assumes; secondly, whether the act is always accompanied by the injection
 of semen received from another; thirdly, as to time and place, whether he
 commits this act more frequently at one time than at another; fourthly,
 whether the act is invisible to any who may be standing by. And on the part
 of the women, it has to be inquired whether only they who were themselves
 conceived in this filthy manner are often visited by devils; or secondly,
 whether it is those who were offered to devils by midwives at the time of
 their birth; and thirdly, whether the actual venereal delectation of such is
 of a weaker sort. But we cannot here reply to all these questions, both
 because we are only engaged in a general study, and because in the second
 part of this work they are all singly explained by their operations, as will
 appear in the fourth chapter, where mention is made of each separate method.
 Therefore, let us now chiefly consider women; and first, why this kind of
 perfidy is found more in so fragile a sex than in men. And our inquiry will
 first be general, as to the general conditions of women; secondly, particular,
 as to which sort of women are found to be given to superstition and
 witchcraft; and thirdly, specifically with regard to midwives, who surpass
 all others in wickedness.



 <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Why Superstition is chiefly found in Women.</i></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As for the first question, why a greater number of witches is found in the
 fragile feminine sex than among men; it is indeed a fact that it were idle
 to contradict, since it is accredited by actual experience, apart from the
 verbal testimony of credibly witnesses. And without in any way detracting
 from a sex in which God has always taken great glory that His might should
 be spread abroad, let us say that various men have assigned various reasons
 for this fact, which nevertheless agree in principle. Wherefore it is good,
 for the admonition of women, to speak of this matter; and it has often been
 proved by experience that they are eager to hear of it, so long as it is set
 forth with discretion.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For some learned men propound this reason; that there are three things in
 nature, the Tongue, an Ecclesiastic, and a Woman, which know no moderation
 in goodness or vice; and when they exceed the bounds of their condition they
 reach the greatest heights and the lowest depths of goodness and vice. When
 they are governed by a good spirit, they are most excellent in virtue; but
 when they are governed by an evil spirit, they indulge the worst possible
 vices.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This is clear in the case of the tongue, since by its ministry most of the
 kingdoms have been brought into the faith of Christ; and the Holy Ghost
 appeared over the Apostles of Christ in tongues of fire. Other learned
 preachers also have had as it were the tongues of dogs, licking wounds and
 sores of the dying Lazarus. As it is said: With the tongues of dogs ye save
 your souls from the enemy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For this reason S. Dominic, the leader and
 father of the Order of Preachers, is represented in the figure of a barking to
 dog with a lighted torch in his mouth, that even to this day he may by his
 barking keep off the heretic wolves from the flock of Christ's sheep.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is also a matter of common experience that the tongue of one prudent man
 can subdue the wrangling of a multitude; wherefore not unjustly Solomon
 sings much in their praise, in <i>Proverbs</i> x.: In the lips of him that
 hath understanding wisdom is found. And again, The tongue of the just is as
 choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth. And again, The lips
 of the righteous feed many; but fools die for want of wisdom. For this
 cause he adds in chapter xvi, The preparations of the heart belong to man;
 but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But concerning an evil tongue you will find in <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxviii:
 A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driven them from nation to
 nation: strong cities hath it pulled down, and overthrown the houses of
 great men. And by a backbiting tongue it means a third party who rashly or
 spitefully interferes between two contending parties.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, concerning Ecclesiastics, that is to say, clerics and religious of
 either sex, S. John Chrysostom speaks on the
 text, He cast out them that bought and sold from the temple. From the
 priesthood arises everything good, and everything evil. S. Jerome in his
 epistle to Nepotian says: Avoid as you would the plague a trading priest,
 who has risen from poverty to riches, from a low to a high estate. And
 Blessed Bernard in his 23rd Homily <i>On the Psalms</i> says of clerics: If
 one should arise as an open heretic, let him be cast out and put to silence;
 if he is a violent enemy, let all good men flee from him. But how are we to
 know which ones to cast out or to flee from? For they are confusedly friendly
 and hostile, peaceable and quarrelsome, neighbourly and utterly selfish.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And in another place: Our bishops are become spearmen, and our pastors
 shearers. And by bishops here is meant those proud Abbots who impose heavy
 labours on their inferiors, which they would not themselves touch with their
 little finger. And S. Gregory says concerning pastors: No one does more harm
 in the Church than he who, having the name or order of sanctity, lives in
 sin; for no one dares to accuse him of sin, and therefore the sin is widely
 spread, since the sinner is honoured for the sanctity of his order. Blessed
 Augustine also speaks of monks to Vincent the Donatist: I freely confess to
 your charity before the Lord our God, which is the witness of my soul from
 the time I began to serve God, what great difficulty I have experienced in
 the fact that it is impossible to find either worse of better men than those
 who grace or disgrace the monasteries.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the wickedness of women is spoken of in <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxv: There
 is no head above the head of a serpent: and there is no wrath above the
 wrath of a woman. I had rather dwell with a lion and a dragon than to keep
 house with a wicked woman. And among much which in that place precedes and
 follows about a wicked woman, he concludes: All wickedness is but little to
 the wickedness of a woman. Wherefore S. John Chrysostom says on the text,
 It is not good to marry (<i>S. Matthew</i> xix):
 What else is woman but a foe to friendship, an unescapable punishment, a
 necessary evil, a natural temptation, a desirable calamity, a domestic
 danger, a delectable detriment, an evil of nature, painted with fair colours!
 Therefore if it be a sin to divorce her when she ought to be kept, it is
 indeed a necessary torture; for either we commit adultery by divorcing her,
 or we must endure daily strife. Cicero in his second book of <i>The
 Rhetorics</i> says: The many lusts of men lead them into one sin, but the
 lust of women leads them into all sins; for the root of all woman's vices
 is avarice. And Seneca says in his <i>Tragedies:</i> A woman either loves
 or hates; there is no third grade. And the tears of woman are a deception,
 for they may spring from true grief, or they may be a snare. When a woman
 thinks alone, she thinks evil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But for good women there is so much praise, that we read that they have
 brought beatitude to men, and have saved nations, lands, and cities; as is
 clear in the case of Judith, Debbora, and Esther. See also I <i>Corinthians</i>
 vii: If a woman hath a husband that believeth not, let her not leave him. For
 the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife. And
 <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxvi: Blessed is the man who has a virtuous wife, for
 the number of his days shell be doubled. And throughout that chapter much
 high praise is spoken of the excellence of good women; as also in the last
 chapter of <i>Proverbs</i> concerning a virtuous woman.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And all this is made clear also in the New Testament concerning women and
 virgins and other holy women who have by faith led nations and kingdoms
 away from the worship of idols to the Christian religion. Anyone who looks
 at Vincent of Beauvais (<i>in Spe. Histo.</i>, XXVI. 9) will find
 marvellous things of the conversion of Hungary by the most Christian
 Gilia, and of the Franks by
 Clotilda, the wife of Clovis. Wherefore in
 many vituperations that we read against women, the word woman is used to
 mean the lust of the flesh. As it is said: I have found a woman more bitter
 than death, and good woman subject to carnal lust.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Other again have propounded other reasons why there are more superstitious
 women found than men. And the first is, that they are more credulous; and
 since the chief aim of the devil is to corrupt faith, therefore he rather
 attacks them. See <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xix: He that is quick to believe is
 light-minded, and shall be diminished. The second reason is, that women are
 naturally more impressionable, and more ready to receive the influence of
 a disembodied spirit; and that when they use this quality well they are
 very good, but when they use it ill they are very evil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third reason is that they have slippery tongues, and are unable to
 conceal from the fellow-women those things which by evil arts they know; and,
 since they are weak, they find an easy and secret manner of vindicating
 themselves by witchcraft. See <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> as quoted above: I had
 rather dwell with a lion and a dragon than to keep house with a wicked
 woman. All wickedness is but little to the wickedness of a woman. And to
 this may be added that, as they are very impressionable, they act
 accordingly.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There are also others who bring forward yet other reasons, of which preachers
 should be very careful how they make use. For it is true that in the Old
 Testament the Scriptures have much that is evil to say about women, and this
 because of the first temptress, Eve, and her imitators; yet afterwards in
 the New Testament we find a change of name, as from Eva to Ave (as S.
 Jerome says), and the whole sin of Eve taken away by the benediction of
 Mary. Therefore preachers should always say as much praise of them as
 possible.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But because in these times this perfidy is more often found in women than
 in men, as we learn by actual experience, if anyone is curious as to the
 reason, we may add to what has already been said the following: that since
 they are feebler both in mind and body, it is not surprising that they
 should come more under the spell of witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For as regards intellect, or the understanding of spiritual things, they
 seem to be of a different nature from men; a fact which is vouched for by
 the logic of the authorities, backed by various examples from the Scriptures.
 Terence says: Women are intellectually like
 children. And Lactantius (<i>Institutiones</i>, III): No woman understood
 philosophy except Temeste. And <i>Proverbs</i>
 xi, as it were describing a woman, says: As a jewel of gold in a swine's
 snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the natural reason is that she is more carnal than a man, as is clear
 from her many carnal abominations. And it should be noted that there was a
 defect in the formation of the first woman, since she was formed from a
 bent rib, that is, a rib of the breast, which is bent as it were in a
 contrary direction to a man. And since through this defect she is an
 imperfect animal, she always deceives. For Cato says: When a woman weeps
 she weaves snares. And again: When a woman weeps, she labours to deceive a
 man. And this is shown by Samson's wife, who coaxed him to tell her the
 riddle he had propounded to the Philistines, and told them the answer, and
 so deceived him. And it is clear in the case of the first woman that she
 had little faith; for when the serpent asked why they did not eat of every
 tree in Paradise, she answered: Of every tree, etc. - lest perchance we
 die. Thereby she showed that she doubted, and had little in the word of God.
 And all this is indicated by the etymology of the word; for <i>Femina</i>
 comes from <i>Fe</i> and <i>Minus</i>, since she is ever weaker to hold and
 preserve the faith. And this as regards faith is of her very nature;
 although both by grace and nature faith never failed in the Blessed Virgin,
 even at the time of Christ's Passion, when it failed in all men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore a wicked woman is by her nature quicker to waver in her faith, and
 consequently quicker to abjure the faith, which is the root of witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as to her other mental quality, that is, her natural will; when she hates
 someone whom she formerly loved, then she seethes with anger and impatience
 in her whole soul, just as the tides of the sea are always heaving and
 boiling. Many authorities allude to this cause. <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxv:
 There is no wrath above the wrath of a woman. And Seneca (<i>Tragedies</i>,
 VIII): No might of the flames or the swollen
 winds, no deadly weapon, is so much to be feared as the lust and hatred of
 a woman who has been divorced from the marriage bed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This is shown too in the woman who falsely accused Joseph, and caused him to
 be imprisoned because he would not consent to the crime of adultery with
 her (<i>Genesis</i> xxx). And truly the most powerful cause which contributes
 to the increase of witches is the woeful rivalry between married folk and
 unmarried women and men. This is so even among holy women, so what must it
 be among the others? For you see in <i>Genesis</i> xxi. how impatient and
 envious Sarah was of Hagar when she conceived: How jealous Rachel was of
 Leah because she had no children (<i>Genesis</i> xxx): and Hannah, who was
 barren, of the fruitful Peninnah (I. <i>Kings</i> i): and how Miriam
 (<i>Numbers</i> xii) murmured and spoke ill of Moses, and was therefore
 stricken with leprosy: and how Martha was jealous of Mary Magdalen, because
 she was busy and Mary was sitting down (<i>S. Luke</i> x). To this point is
 <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxxvii: Neither consult with a woman touching her of
 whom she is jealous. Meaning that it is useless to consult with her, since
 there is always jealousy, that is, envy, in a wicked woman. And if women
 behave thus to each other, how much more will they do so to men.<br/>

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question VII</h2>
<h3>Whether Witches can Sway the Minds of Men to Love or Hatred.</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is asked whether devils, through the medium of witches, can change or
 incite the minds of men to inordinate love or hatred; and it is argued that,
 following the previous conclusions, they cannot do so. For there are three
 things in man: will, understanding, and body. The first is ruled by God
 (for, The heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord); the second is
 enlightened by an Angel; and the body is governed by the motions of the
 stars. And as the devils cannot effect changes in the body, even less have
 they power to incite love or hatred in the soul. The consequence is clear;
 that though they have more power over things corporeal than over things
 spiritual, they cannot change even the body, as has been often proved. For
 they cannot induce any substantial or accidental form, except is as it were
 their artificer. In this connexion is quoted what has been said before;
 that whoever believes that any creature can be changed for the better or
 worse or transformed into another kind or likeness, except by the Creator
 of all things, is worse than a pagan and a heretic.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, everything that acts with design knows its own effect. If,
 therefore, the devil could change the minds of men to hatred or love, he
 would also be able to see the inner thoughts of the heart; but this is
 contrary to what is said in the Book of Ecclesiastic Dogma: The devil cannot
 see our inner thoughts. And again in the same place: Not all our evil
 thoughts are from the devil, but sometimes they arise from our own choice.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, love and hatred are a matter of the will, which is rooted in the
 soul; therefore they cannot by any cunning be caused by the devil. The
 conclusion holds that He alone (as S. Augustine says) is able to enter into
 the soul, Who created it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, it is not valid to argue that because he can influence the inner
 emotions, therefore he can govern the will. For the emotions are stronger
 than physical strength; and the devil can effect nothing in a physical way,
 such as the formation of flesh and blood; therefore he can effect nothing
 through the emotions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>But against this</i>. The devil is said to tempt men not only visibly
 but also invisibly; but this would not be true unless he were able to exert
 some influence over the inner mind. Besides, S. John Damascene says: All evil
 and all filthiness is devised by the devil. And Dionysius, <i>de Divin.
 Nom.</i> IV: The multitude of devils is the cause of all evil, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. First, one sort of cause is to be distinguished from another:
 secondly, we shall show how the devil can affect the inner powers of the
 mind, that is the emotions; and thirdly, we shall draw the fit conclusion.
 And as to the first, it is to be considered that the cause of anything can
 be understood in two ways; either as direct, or as indirect. For when
 something cause a disposition to some effect, it is said to be an occasional
 and indirect cause of that effect. In this way it may be said that he who
 chops wood is the cause of the actual fire. And similarly we may say that
 the devil is the cause of all our sins; for he incited the first man to sin,
 from whose sin it has been handed down to the whole human race to have an
 inclination towards sin. And in this way are to be understood the words of
 S. John Damascene and Dionysius.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But a direct cause is one that directly causes an effect; and in this sense
 the devil is not the cause of all sin. For all sins are not committed at the
 instigation of the devil, but some are of our own choosing. For Origen says:
 Even if the devil were not, men would still lust after food and venery and
 such things. And from these inordinate lusts much may result, unless such
 appetites be reasonably restrained. But to restrain such ungoverned desire
 is the part of man's free-will, over which even the devil has no power.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And because this distinction is not sufficient to explain how the devil at
 times produces a frantic infatuation of love, it is further to be noted
 that though he cannot cause that inordinate love by directly compelling a
 man's will, yet he can do so by means of persuasion. And this again in two
 ways, either visibly or invisibly. Visibly, when he appears to witches in
 the form of a man, and speaks to them materially, persuading them to sin.
 So he tempted our first parents in Paradise in the form of a serpent; and
 so he tempted Christ in the wilderness, appearing to Him in visible form.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it is not to be thought that this is the only way he influences a man;
 for in that case no sin would proceed from the devil's instruction, except
 such as were suggested by him in visible form. Therefore it must be said
 that even invisibly he instigates man to sin. And this he does in two ways,
 either by persuasion or by disposition. By persuasion, he presents something
 to the understanding as being a good thing. And this he can do in three ways;
 for he presents it either to the intellect, or to the inner perceptions, or
 to the outer. And as for the intellect; the human intellect can be helped by
 a good Angel to understand a thing by means of enlightenment, as Dionysius
 says; and to understand a thing, according to Aristotle, is to suffer
 something: therefore the devil can impress some form upon the intellect, by
 which the act of understanding is called forth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it may be argued that the devil can do this by his natural power, which
 is not, as had been shown, diminished. <i>It is to be said</i>, however,
 that he cannot do this by means of enlightenment, but by persuasion. For the
 intellect of man is of that condition that, the more it is enlightened, the
 more it knows the truth, and the more it can defend itself from deception.
 And because the devil intends his deception to be permanent, therefore no
 persuasion that he uses can be called enlightenment: although it may be
 called revelation, in that when he invisibly uses persuasion, by means of
 some impression he plants something on the inner or outer sense. And by this
 the reasoning intellect is persuaded to perform some action.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But as to how he is enabled to create an impression on the inner sense,
 <i>it is to be noted</i> that the bodily nature is naturally born to be
 moved locally by the spiritual; which is clear from the case of our own
 bodies, which are moved by souls; and the same is the case with the stars.
 But it is not by nature adapted to be directly subject to influences, by
 which we mean outside influences, not those with which it is informed.
 Wherefore the concurrence of some bodily agent is necessary, as is proved
 in the 7th book of the <i>Metaphysics</i>. Corporeal matter naturally obeys
 a good or bad angel as to the local motion; and it is due to this that
 devils can through motion collect semen, and employ it for the production
 of wonderful results. This was how it happened that Pharao's magicians
 produced serpents and actual animals, when corresponding active and passive
 agents were brought together. Therefore there is nothing to prevent the
 devils from effecting anything that appertains to the local motion of
 corporeal matter, unless God prevent it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And now let us examine how the devil can through local motion excite the
 fancy and inner sensory perceptions of a man by apparitions and impulsive
 actions. It is to be noted that Aristotle (<i>De Somno et Uigilia</i>)
 assigns the cause of apparitions in dreams through local motion to the fact
 that, when an animal sleeps the blood flows to the inmost seat of the senses,
 from which descend motions or impressions which remain from past impressions
 preserved in the mind or inner perception; and these are Fancy or Imagination,
 which are the same thing according to S. Thomas, as will be shown.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For fancy or imagination is as it were the treasury of ideas received
 through the senses. And through this it happens that devils stir up the
 inner perceptions, that is the power of conserving images, that they appear
 to be a new impression at that moment received from exterior things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is true that all do not agree to this; but if anyone wishes to occupy
 himself with this question, he must consider the number and the office of
 the inner perceptions. According to Avicenna, in his book <i>On the Mind</i>,
 these are five: namely, Common Sense, Fancy, Imagination, Thought, and
 Memory. But S. Thomas, in the First Part of Question 79, says that they are
 only four, since Fancy and Imagination are the same thing. For fear of
 prolixity I omit much more that has variously been said on this subject.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Only this must be said; that fancy is the treasury of ideas, but memory
 appears to be something different. For fancy is the treasury or repository
 of ideas received through the senses; but memory is the treasury of
 instincts, which are not received through the senses. For when a man sees
 a wolf, he runs away, not because of its ugly colour or appearance, which
 are ideas received through the outer senses and conserved in his fancy; but
 he runs away because the wolf is his natural enemy. And this he knows through
 some instinct or fear, which is apart from thought, which recognized the
 wolf as hostile, but a dog as friendly. But the repository of those instincts
 is memory. And reception and retention are two different things in animal
 nature; for those who are of a humid disposition receive readily, but retain
 badly; and the contrary is the case of those with a dry humour.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To return to the question. The apparitions that come in dreams to sleepers
 proceed from the ideas retained in the repository of their mind, through a
 natural local motion caused by the flow of blood to the first and inmost
 seat of their faculties of perception; and we speak of an instrinsic local
 motion in the head and the cells of the brain.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this can also happen through a similar local motion created by devils.
 Also such things happen not only to the sleeping, but even to those who are
 awake. For in these also the devils can stir up and excite the inner
 perceptions and humours, so that ideas retained in the repositories of their
 minds are drawn out and made apparent to the faculties of fancy and
 imagination, so that such men imagine these things to be true. And this is
 called interior temptation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is no wonder that the devil can do this by his own natural power;
 since any man by himself, being awake and having the use of his reason, can
 voluntarily draw from his repositories the images he has retained in them;
 in such a way that he can summon to himself the images of whatsoever things
 he pleases. And this being granted, it is easy to understand the matter of
 excessive infatuation in love.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now there are two ways in which devils can, as has been said, raise up this
 kind of images. Sometimes they work without enchaining the human reason, as
 has been said in the matter of temptation, and the example of voluntary
 imagination. But sometimes the use of reason is entirely chained up; and
 this may be exemplified by certain naturally defective persons, and by
 madmen and drunkards. Therefore it is no wonder that devils can, with God's
 permission, chain up the reason; and such men are called delirious, because
 their senses have been snatched away by the devil. And this they do in two
 ways, either with or without the help of witches. For Aristotle, in the work
 we have quoted, says that anyone who lives in passion is moved by only a
 little thing, as a lover by the remotest likeness of his love, and similarly
 with one who feels hatred. Therefore devils, who have learned from men's
 acts to which passions they are chiefly subject, incite them to this sort of
 inordinate love or hatred, impressing their purpose on men's imagination the
 more strongly and effectively, as they can do so the more easily. And this
 is the more easy for a lover to summon up the image of his love from his
 memory, and retain it pleasurably in his thoughts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But they work by witchcraft when they do these things through and at the
 instance of witches, by reason of a pact entered into with them. But it is
 not possible to treat of such matters in detail, on account of the great
 number of instances both among the clergy and among the laity. For how many
 adulterers have put away the most beautiful wives to lust after the vilest
 of women!<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We know of an old woman who, according to the common account of the brothers
 in that monastery even up to this day, in this manner not only bewitched
 three successive Abbots, but even killed them, and in the same way drove the
 fourth out of his mind. For she herself publicly confessed it, and does not
 fear to say: I did so and I do so, and they are not able to keep from loving
 me because they have eaten so much of my dung - measuring off a certain
 length on her arm. I confess, moreover, that since we had no case to
 prosecute her or bring her to trial, she survives to this day.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It will be remembered that it was said that the devil invisibly lures a man
 to sin, not only by means of persuasion, as has been said, but also by the
 means of disposition. Although this is not very pertinent, yet be it said
 that by a similar admonition of the disposition and humours of men, he
 renders some more disposed to anger, or concupiscence, or other passions.
 For it is manifest that a man who has a body so disposed is more prone to
 concupiscence and anger and such passions; and when they are aroused, he is
 more apt to surrender to them. But because it is difficult to quote
 precedents, therefore an easier method must be found of declaring them for
 the admonition of the people. And in the Second Part of this book we treat
 of the remedies by which men so bewitched can be set free.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question VIII</h2>
<h3>Whether Witches can Hebetate the Powers of Generation or Obstruct the Venereal Act.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the fact that adulterous drabs and whores are chiefly given to
 witchcraft is substantiated by the spells which are cast by witches upon the
 act of generation. And to make the truth more clear, we will consider the
 arguments of those who are in disagreement with us on this matter. And first
 it is argued that such a bewitching is not possible, because if it were it
 would apply equally to those who are married; and if this were conceded,
 then, since matrimony is God's work and witchcraft is the devil's, the
 devil's work would be stronger than God's. But if it is allowed that it can
 only affect fornicators and the unmarried, this involves a return to the
 opinion that witchcraft does not really exist, but only in men's imagination;
 and this was refuted in the First Question. Or else some reason will be
 found why it should affect the unmarried and not the married; and the only
 possible reason is that matrimony is God's work. And since, according to the
 Theologians, this reason is not valid, there still remains the argument
 that it would make the devil's work stronger than God's; and since it would
 be unseemly to make such an assertion, it is also unseemly to maintain that
 the venereal act can be obstructed by witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, the devil cannot obstruct the other natural actions, such as eating,
 walking and standing, as is apparent from the fact that, if he could, he
 could destroy the whole world.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, since the venereal act is common to all women, if it were obstructed
 it would be so with reference to all women; but this is not so, and therefore
 the first argument is good. For the facts prove that it is not so; for when
 a man says that he has been bewitched, he is still quite capable as regards
 other women, though not with her with whom he is unable to copulate; and
 the reason for this is that he does not wish to, and therefore cannot effect
 anything in the matter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On the contrary and true side is the chapter in the Decretals (If by
 sortilege, etc.): as is also the opinion of all the Theologians and Canonists,
 where they treat of the obstruction to marriage caused by witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is also another reason: that since the devil is more powerful than
 man, and a man can obstruct the generative powers by means of frigid herbs
 or anything else that can be thought of, therefore much more can the devil
 do this, since he has greater knowledge and cunning.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. The truth is sufficiently evident from two matters which have
 already been argued, although the method of obstruction has not been
 specifically declared. For it has been shown that witchcraft does not exist
 only in men's imaginations, and not in fact; but that truly and actually
 in numerable bewitchments can happen, with the permission of God. It has
 been shown, too, that God permits it more in the case of the generative
 powers, because of their greater corruption, than in the case of other
 human actions. But concerning the method by which such obstruction is
 procured, it is to be noted that it does not affect only the generative
 powers, but also the powers of the imagination or fancy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as to this, Peter of Palude (III, 34) notes five methods. For he says
 that the devil, being a spirit, has power over a corporeal creature to cause
 or prevent a local motion. Therefore he can prevent bodies from approaching
 each other, either directly or indirectly, by interposing himself in some
 bodily shape. In this way it happened to the young man who was betrothed to
 an idol and nevertheless married a young maiden, and was consequently unable
 to copulate with her. Secondly, he can excite a man to that act, or freeze
 his desire for it, by the virtue of secret things of which he best knows the
 power. Thirdly, he can also disturb a man's perception and imagination as to
 make the woman appear loathsome to him: since he can, as had been said,
 influence the imagination. Fourthly, he can directly prevent the erection of
 that member which is adapted to fructification, just as he can prevent local
 motion. Fifthly, he can prevent the flow of the vital essence to the members
 in which lie the motive power; by closing as it were the seminary ducts, so
 that it does not descend to the generative channels, or falls back from
 them, or does not project from them, or in any of many ways fails in its
 function.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And he continues in agreement with what has been treated of above by other
 Doctors. For God allows the devil more latitude in respect of this act,
 through which sin was first spread abroad, than of other human acts.
 Similarly, serpents are more subject to magic spells than are other animals.
 And a little later he says: It is the same in the case of a woman, for the
 devil can so darken her understanding that she considers her husband so
 loathsome that not for all the world would she allow him to lie with her.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Later he wishes to find the reason why more men than women are bewitched in
 respect of that action; and he says that such obstruction generally occurs
 in the matter of erection, which can more easily happen to men; and therefore
 more men than women are bewitched. It might also be said that, the greater
 part of witches being women, they lust more for men than for women. Also
 they act in the despite of married women, finding every opportunity for
 adultery when the husband is able to copulate with other women but not with
 his own wife; and similarly the wife also has to seek other lovers.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 He adds also that God allows the devil to afflict sinners more bitterly than
 the just. Wherefore the Angel said to Tobias: He gives the devil power over
 those who are given up to lust. But he has power also against the just
 sometimes, as in the case of Job, but not in respect of the genital
 functions. Wherefore they ought to devote themselves to confession and other
 good works, lest the iron remain in the wound, and it be in vain to apply
 remedies. So much for Peter. But the method of removing such effects will be
 shown in the Second Part of this work.


 <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Some Incidental Doubts on the subject of Copulation<br/>prevented
 by Evil Spells are made Clear.</i></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But incidentally, if it is asked why this function is sometimes obstructed
 in respect of one woman but not of another, the answer, according to S.
 Bonaventura, is this. Either the enchantress of witch afflicts in this way
 those persons upon whom the devil has determined; or it is because God will
 not permit it to be inflicted on certain persons. For the hidden purpose of
 God in this is obscure, as is shown in the case of the wife of Tobias. And
 he adds:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 If it is asked how the devil does this, it is to be said that he obstructs
 the genital power, not intrinsically by harming the organ, but extrinsically
 by rendering it useless. Therefore, since it is an artificial and not a
 natural obstruction, he can make a man impotent towards one woman but not
 towards others: by taking away the inflammation of his lust for her, but
 not for other women, either through his own power, or through some herb or
 stone, or some occult natural means. And this agrees with the words of
 Peter of Palude.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, since impotency in this act is sometimes due to coldness of nature,
 or some natural defect, it is asked how it is possible to distinguish
 whether it is due to witchcraft of not. Hostiensis gives the answer in his
 <i>Summa</i> (but this must not be publicly preached): When the member is in
 no way stirred, and can never perform the act of coition, this is a sign
 of frigidity of nature; but when it is stirred and becomes erect, but yet
 cannot perform, it is a sign of witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is to be noted also that impotence of the member to perform the act is
 not the only bewitchment; but sometimes the woman is caused to be unable to
 conceive, or else she miscarries.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Note, moreover, that according to what is aid down by the Canons, whoever
 through desire of vengeance or for hatred does anything to a man or a woman
 to prevent them from begetting or conceiving must be considered a homicide.
 And note, further, that the Canon speaks of loose lovers who, to save their
 mistresses from shame, use contraceptives, such as potions, or herbs that
 contravene nature, without any help from devils. And such penitents are to
 be punished as homicides. But witches who do such things by witchcraft are
 by law punishable by the extreme penalty, as had been touched on above in
 the First Question.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And for a solution of the arguments; when it is objected that these things
 cannot happen to those joined together in matrimony, it is further to be
 noted that, even if the truth in this matter had not already been made
 sufficiently plain, yet these things can truly and actually happen just as
 much to those who are married as to those who are not. And the prudent reader
 who has plenty of books, will refer to the Theologians and the Canonists,
 especially where they speak of the impotent and bewitched. He will find them
 in agreement in condemning two errors: especially with regard to married
 people who seem to think that such bewitchment cannot happen to those who
 are joined in matrimony, advancing the reason that the devil cannot destroy
 the works of God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the first error which they condemn is that of those who say that there
 is no witchcraft in the world, but only in the imagination of men who,
 through their ignorance of hidden causes which no man yet understands,
 ascribe certain natural effects to witchcraft, as though they were effected
 not by hidden causes, but by devils working either by themselves or in
 conjunction with witches. And although all other Doctors condemn this error
 as a pure falsehood, yet S. Thomas impugns it more vigorously and stigmatizes
 it as actual heresy, saying that this error proceeds from the root of
 infidelity. And since infidelity in a Christian is accounted heresy,
 therefore such deserve to be suspected as heretics. And this matter was
 touched on in the First Question, though it was not there declared so
 plainly. For if anyone considers the other sayings of S. Thomas in other
 places, he will find the reasons why he affirms that such an error proceeds
 from the root of infidelity.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For in his questions concerning Sin, where he treats of devils, and in his
 first question, whether devils have bodies that naturally belong to them,
 among many other matters he makes mention of those who referred every
 physical effect to the virtue of the stars; to which they said that the
 hidden causes of terrestrial effects were subject. And he says: It must be
 considered that the Peripatetics,the followers of Aristotle, held that devils
 did not really exist; but that those things which are attributed to devils
 proceeded from the power of the stars and other natural phenomena. Wherefore
 S. Augustine says (<i>de Ciuitate Dei</i>, X), that it was the opinion of
 Porphyry that from herbs and animals, and certain sounds and voice, and from
 figures and figments observed in the motion of the stars, powers
 corresponding to the stars were fabricated on earth by men in order to
 explain various natural effect. And the error of these is plain, since they
 referred everything to hidden causes in the stars, holding that devils were
 only fabricated by the imagination of men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But this opinion is clearly proved to be false by S. Thomas in the same
 work; for some works of devils are found which can in no way proceed from
 any natural cause. For example, when one who is possessed by devil speaks in
 an unknown language; and many other devil's works are found, both in the
 Rhapsodic and the Necromantic arts, which can in no way proceed except from
 some Intelligence, which may be naturally good but is evil in its intention.
 And therefore, because of these incongruities, other Philosophers were
 compelled to admit that there were devils. Yet they afterwards fell into
 various errors, some thinking that the souls of men, when they left their
 bodies, became devils. For this reason many Soothsayers have killed children,
 that they might have their souls as their co-operators; and many other
 errors are recounted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this it is clear that not without reason does the Holy Doctor say that
 such an opinion proceeds from the root of infidelity. And anyone who wishes
 may read S. Augustine (<i>de Ciuitate Dei</i>, VIII, IX) on the various
 errors of infidels concerning the nature of devils. And indeed the common
 opinion of all Doctors, quoted in the above-mentioned work, against those
 who err in this way by denying that there are any witches, is very weighty
 in its meaning, even if it is expressed in few words. For they say that they
 who maintain that there is no witchcraft in the world go contrary to the
 opinion of all the Doctors, and of the Holy Scripture; and declare that
 there are devils, and that devils have power over the bodies and imaginations
 of men, with the permission of God. Wherefore, those who are the instruments
 of the devils, at whose instance the devil at times do mischief to a
 creature, they call witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now in the Doctor's condemnation of this first error nothing is said
 concerning those joined together in matrimony; but this is made clear in
 their condemnation of the second error of believing that, though witchcraft
 exists and abounds in the world, even against carnal copulation, yet, since
 no such bewitchment can be considered to be permanent, it never annuls a
 marriage that has already been contracted. Here is where they speak of those
 joined in matrimony. Now in refuting this error (for we do so, even though
 it is little to the point, for the sake of those who have not many books),
 it is to be noted that they refute it by maintaining that it is against all
 precedent, and contrary to all laws both ancient and modern.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore the Catholic Doctors make the following distinction, that impotence
 caused by witchcraft is either temporary or permanent. And if it is
 temporary, then it does not annul the marriage. Moreover, it is presumed
 to be temporary of they are able to healed of the impediment within three
 years from their cohabitation, having taken all possible pain, either
 through the sacraments of the Church, or through other remedies, to be
 cured. But if they are not then cured by any remedy, from that time it is
 presumed to be permanent. And in that case it either precedes both the
 contracting of a marriage, and annuls one that is not yet contracted; or
 else it follows the contract of marriage but precedes its consummation,
 and then also, according to some, it annuls the previous contract. (For it
 is said in Book XXXII, quest. 1. cap. 1 that the confirmation of a marriage
 consists in its carnal office.) Or else it is subsequent to the
 consummation of the marriage, and then the matrimonial bond is not annulled.
 Much is noted there concerning impotence by Hostiensis, and Godfrey, and the
 Doctors and Theologians.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>To the arguments</i>. As to the first, it is made sufficiently clear from
 what has been said. For as to the argument that God's works can be destroyed
 by the devil's works, if witchcraft has power against those who are married,
 it has no force; rather does the opposite appear, since the devil can do
 nothing without God's permission. For he does not destroy by main force
 like a tyrant, but through some extrinsic art, as is proved above. And the
 second argument is also made quite clear, why God allows this obstruction
 more in the case of the venereal act than of other acts. But the devil has
 power also over other acts, when God permits. Wherefore it is not sound to
 argue that he could destroy the whole world. And the third objection is
 similarly answered by what has been said.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question IX</h2>
<h3>Whether Witches may work some Prestidigatory Illusion so that the Male Organ appears to be entirely removed and separate from the Body.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here is declared the truth about diabolic operations with regard to the male
 organ. And to make plain the facts in this matter, it is asked whether
 witches can with the help of devils really and actually remove the member,
 or whether they only do so apparently by some glamour or illusion. And that
 they can actually do so is argued <i>a fortiori</i>; for since devils can
 do greater things than this, as killing them or carrying them from place
 to place - as was shown above in the cases of Job and Tobias - therefore
 they can also truly and actually remove men's members.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, an argument is taken from the gloss on the visitations of bad Angels,
 in the Psalms: God punishes by means of bad Angels, as He often punished
 the People of Israel with various diseases, truly and actually visited upon
 their bodies. Therefore the member is equally subject to such visitations.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It may be said that this is done with the Divine permission. And in that
 case, it has already been said that God allows more power of witchcraft over
 the genital functions, on account of the first corruption of sin which came
 to us from the act of generation, so also He allows greater power over the
 actual genital organ, even to its removal.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again, it was a greater thing to turn Lot's wife into a pillar of salt
 than it is to take away the male organ; and that (<i>Genesis</i> xix) was a
 real and actual, not an apparent, metamorphosis (for it is said that that
 pillar is still to be seen), And this was done by a bad Angel; just as the
 good Angels struck the men of Sodom with blindness, so that they could not
 find the door of the house. And so it was with the other punishments of the
 men of Gomorrah. The gloss, indeed, affirms that Lot's wife was herself
 tainted with that vice, and therefore she was punished.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again, whoever can create a natural shape can also take it away. But
 devils have created many natural shapes, as is clear from Pharao's magicians,
 who with the help of devils made frogs and serpents. Also S. Augustine, in
 Book LXXXIII, says that those things which are visibly done by the lower
 powers of the air cannot be considered to be mere illusions; but even men
 are able, by some skilful incision, to remove the male organ; therefore
 devils can do invisibly what others do visibly.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But on the contrary side, S. Augustine (<i>de Ciuitate Dei</i>, XVIII) says:
 It is not to be believed that, through the art or power of devils, man's
 body can be changed into the likeness of a beast; therefore it is equally
 impossible that that should be removed which is essential to the truth of
 the human body, Also he says (<i>de Trinitate</i>, III): It must not be
 thought that this substance of visible matter is subject to the will of
 those fallen angels; for it is subject only to God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. There is no doubt that certain witches can do marvellous
 things with regard to male organs, for this agrees with what has been seen
 and heard by many, and with the general account of what has been known
 concerning that member through the senses of sight and touch. And as to how
 this thing is possible, it is to be said that it can be done in two ways,
 either actually and in fact, as the first arguments have said, or through
 some prestige or glamour. But when it is performed by witches, it is only a
 matter of glamour; although it is no illusion in the opinion of the sufferer.
 For his imagination can really and actually believe that something is not
 present, since by none of his exterior sense, such as sight or touch, can
 he perceive that it is present.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this it may be said that there is a true abstraction of the member in
 imagination, although not in fact; and several things are to be noted as to
 how this happens. And first as to two methods by which it can be done. It is
 no wonder that the devil can deceive the outer human senses, since, as has
 been treated of above, he can illude the inner senses, by bringing to actual
 perception ideas that are stored in the imagination. Moreover, he deceives
 men in their natural functions, causing that which is visible to be
 invisible to them, and that which is tangible to be intangible, and the
 audible inaudible, and so with the other senses. But such things are not
 true in actual fact, since they are caused through some defect introduced
 in the sense, such as the eyes or the ears, or the touch, by reason of which
 defect a man's judgement is deceived.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we can illustrate this from certain natural phenomena. For sweet wine
 appears bitter on the tongue of the fevered, his taste being deceived not by
 the actual fact, but through his disease. So also in the case under
 consideration, the deception is not due to fact, since the member is still
 actually in its place; but it is an illusion of the sense with regard to it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, as has been said above concerning the generative powers, the devil
 can obstruct that action by imposing some other body of the same colour
 and appearance, in such a way that some smoothly fashioned body in the colour
 of flesh is interposed between the sight and touch, and between the true
 body of the sufferer, so that it seems to him that he can see and feel
 nothing but a smooth body with its surface interrupted by no genital organ.
 See the sayings of S. Thomas (2 dist. 8. artic. 5) concerning glamours and
 illusions, and also in the second of the second, 91, and in his questions
 concerning Sin; where he frequently quotes that of S. Augustine in Book
 LXXXIII: This evil of the devil creeps in through all the sensual approaches;
 he gives himself to figures, he adapts himself to colours, he abides in
 sounds, he lurks in smells, he infuses himself into flavours.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, it is to be considered that such an illusion of the sight and touch
 can be caused not only by the interposition of some smooth unmembered body,
 but also by the summoning to the fancy or imagination of certain forms and
 ideas latent in the mind, in such a way that a thing is imagined as being
 perceived then for the first time. For, as was shown in the preceding
 question, devils can by their own power change bodies locally; and just as
 the disposition or humour can be affected in this way, so can the natural
 functions. I speak of things which appear natural to the imagination or
 senses. For Aristotle in the <i>de Somno et Uigila</i> says, assigning the
 cause of apparitions in dreams, that when an animal sleeps much blood flows
 to the inner consciousness, and thence come ideas or impressions derived
 from actual previous experiences stored in the mind. It has already been
 defined how thus certain appearance convey the impressions of new
 experiences. And since this can happen naturally, much more can the devil
 call to the imagination the appearance of a smooth body unprovided with the
 virile member, in such a way that the sense believe it to be an actual fact.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, some other methods are to be noted which are easier to understand
 and to explain. For, according to S. Isidore (<i>Etym.</i> VIII, 9), a
 glamour is nothing but a certain delusion of the senses, and especially of
 the eyes. And for this reason it is also called a prestige, from <i>prestringo</i>,
 since the sight of the eyes is so fettered that things seem to be other
 than they are. And Alexander of Hales, Part 2,
 says that a prestige, properly understood, is an illusion of the devil,
 which is not caused by any change in matter, but only exists in the mind of
 him who is deluded, either as to his inner or outer perceptions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore, in a manner of speaking, we may say even of human prestidigitatory
 art, that it can be effected in three ways. For the first, it can be done
 without devils, since it is artificially done by the agility of men who show
 things and conceal them, as in the case of the tricks of conjurers and
 ventriloquists. The second method is also without the help of devils; as
 when men can use some natural virtue in natural bodies or minerals so as to
 impart to such objects some other appearance quite different from their true
 appearance. Wherefore, according to S. Thomas (I, 114, 4), and several
 others, men, by the smoke of certain smouldering or lighted herbs, can make
 rods appear to be serpents.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third method of delusion is effected with the help of devils, the
 permission of God being granted. For it is clear that devils have, of their
 nature, some power over certain earthly matters, which they exercise upon
 them, when God permits, so that things appear to be other than they are.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as to this third method, it is to be noted that the devil has fives
 ways in which he can delude anyone so that he thinks a thing to be other
 than it is. First, by an artificial tricks, as has been said; for that which
 a man can do by art, the devil can do even better. Second, by a natural
 method, by the application, as has been said, and interposition of some
 substance so as to hide the true body, or by confusing it in man's fancy.
 The third way is when in an assumed body he presents himself as being
 something which he is not; as witness the story which S. Gregory tells in
 his <i>First Dialogue</i> of a Nun, who ate a lettuce, which, however, as
 the devil confessed, was not a lettuce, but the devil in the form of a
 lettuce, or in the lettuce itself. Or as when he appeared to S. Antony in a
 lump of gold which he found in the desert. Or as when he touches a real man,
 and makes him appear like a brute animal, as will shortly be explained. The
 fourth method is when he confuses the organ of sight, so that a clear thing
 seems hazy, or the converse, or when an old woman appears to be a young girl.
 For even after weeping the light appears different from what it was before.
 His fifth method is by working in the imaginative power, and, by a
 disturbance of the humours, effecting a transmutation in the forms perceived
 by the senses, as has been treated of before, so that the senses then
 perceive as it were fresh and new images. And accordingly, by the last three
 of these methods, and even by the second, the devil can cast a glamour over
 the senses of a man. Wherefore there is no difficulty in his concealing the
 virile member by some prestige or glamour. And a manifest proof or example
 of this, which was revealed to us in our Inquisitorial capacity, will be
 set forth later, where more is recounted of these and other matters in the
 Second Part of this Treatise.


 <div style="text-align: center;"><i>How a Bewitchment can be Distinguished from a Natural Defect.</i></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 An incidental question, with certain other difficulties, follows. Peter's
 member has been taken off, and he does not know whether it is by witchcraft
 or in some other way by the devil's power, with the permission of God. Are
 there any ways of determining or distinguishing between these? It can be
 answered as follows. First, that those to whom such things most commonly
 happen are adulterers or fornicators. For when they fail to respond to the
 demand of their mistress, or if they wish to desert them and attach
 themselves to other women, then their mistress, out of vengeance, through
 some other power causes their members to be taken off. Secondly, it can be
 distinguished by the fact that it is not permanent. For if it is not due to
 witchcraft, then the loss is not permanent, but it will be restored some
 time.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But here there arises another doubt, whether it is due to the nature of the
 witchcraft that it is not permanent. It is answered that it can be permanent,
 and last until death, just as the Canonists and Theologians judge concerning
 the impediment of witchcraft in matrimony, that the temporary can become
 permanent. For Godfrey says in his <i>Summa</i>: A bewitchment cannot always
 be removed by him who caused it, either because he is dead, or because he
 does not know how to remove it, or because the charm has been lost.
 Wherefore we may say in the same way that the charm which has been worked
 on Peter will be permanent if the witch who did it cannot heal him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For there are three degrees of witches. For some both heal and harm; some
 harm, but cannot heal; and some seem able only to heal, that is, to take
 away injuries, as will be shown later. For thus it happened to us: Two
 witches were quarreling, and while they were taunting each other one said:
 I am not so wicked as you, for I know how to heal those whom I injure. The
 charm will also be permanent if, before it has been healed, the witch
 departs, either by changing her dwelling or by dying. For S. Thomas also
 says: Any charm may be permanent when it is such as can have no human
 remedy; or if it has a remedy, it is not known to men, or unlawful; although
 God can find a remedy through a holy Angel who can coerce the devil, if not
 the witch.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 However, the chief remedy against witchcraft is the sacrament of Penitence.
 For bodily infirmity often proceeds from sin. And how the charms or witches
 can be removed will be shown in the Second Part of this Treatise, and in the
 Second QUestion, chapter VI, where other different matters are treated of
 and explained.


 <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Solutions of the Arguments.</i></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the first, it is clear that there is no doubt but that, just as, with
 God's permission, they can kill men, so also can devils taken off that
 member, as well as others, truly and actually. But then the devils do not
 work through the medium of witches, concerning which mention has already
 been made. And from this the answer to the second argument is also made
 clear. But this is to be said: that God allows more power of witchcraft over
 the genital forces because, etc.; and therefore even allows that that member
 should be truly and actually taken off. But it is not valid to say that this
 always happens. For it would not be after the manner of witchcraft for it to
 happen so; and even the witches, when they do such works, do not pretend
 that they have not the power to restore the member when they wish to and
 know how to do so. From which it is clear that it is not actually taken off,
 but only by a glamour. As for the third, concerning the metamorphosis of
 Lot's wife, we say that this was actual, and not a glamour. And as to the
 fourth, that devils can create certain substantial shapes, and therefore can
 also remove them: it is to be said with regard to Pharaoh's magicians that
 they made true serpents; and that devils can, with the help of another agent,
 produce certain effects on imperfect creatures which they cannot on men, who
 are God's chief care. For it is said: Does God care for oxen? They can,
 nevertheless, with the permission of God, do to men true and actual harm,
 as also they can create a glamour of harm, and by this the answer to the
 last argument is made clear.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question X</h2>
<h3>Whether Witches can by some Glamour Change Men into Beasts.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here we declare the truth as to whether and how witches transform men into
 beasts. And it is argued that this is not possible, from the following
 passage of <i>Episcopus</i> (XXVI, 5): Whoever believes that it is possible
 for any creature to be changed for the better or for the worse, or to be
 transformed into any other shape or likeness, except by the Creator Himself,
 Who made all things, is without doubt an infidel, and worse than a pagan.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we will quote the arguments of S. Thomas in the <i>2nd Book of Sentences</i>,
 VIII: Whether devils can affect the bodily sense by the delusion of a
 glamour. There he argues first that they cannot. For though that shape of a
 beast which is seen must be somewhere, it cannot exist only in the senses;
 for the sense perceive no shape that is not received from actual matter, and
 there is no actual beast there; and he adduces the authority of the Canon.
 And again, that which seems to be, cannot really be; as in the case of a
 woman who seems to be a beast, for two substantial shapes cannot exist at
 one and the same time in the same matter. Therefore, since that shape of a
 beast which appears cannot exist anywhere, no glamour or illusion can exist
 in the eye of the beholder; for the sight must have some object in which it
 terminates.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if it is argued that the shape exists in the surrounding atmosphere,
 this is not possible; both because the atmosphere is not capable of taking
 any shape or form, and also because the air around that person is not always
 constant, and cannot be so on account of its fluid nature, especially when
 it is moved. And again because in that case such a transformation would be
 visible to everyone; but this is not so, because the devils seem to be
 unable to deceive the sight of Holy Men in the least.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, the sense of sight, or the faculty of vision, is a passive faculty,
 and every passive faculty is set in motion by the active agent that
 corresponds to it. Now the active agent corresponding to sight is twofold:
 one is the origin of the act, or the object; the other is the carrier, or
 medium. But that apparent shape cannot be the object of the sense, neither
 can it be the medium through which it is carried. First, it cannot be the
 object, since it cannot be taken hold of by anything, as was shown in the
 foregoing argument, since it does not exist in the senses received from an
 object, neither is it in the actual object, nor even in the air, as in a
 carrying medium, as was treated of above in the third argument.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, if the devil moves the inner consciousness, he does so either by
 projecting himself into the cognitive faculty, or by changing it. But he
 does not do so by projecting himself; for he would either have to assume a
 body, and even so could not penetrate into the inner organ of imagination;
 for two bodies cannot be at the same time in the same place; or he would
 assume a phantasmal body; and this again would be impossible, since no
 phantasm is quite without substance.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Similarly also he cannot do it by changing the cognition. For he would either
 change it by alteration, which he does not seem able to do, since all
 alteration is caused by active qualities, in which the devils are lacking;
 or he would change it by transformation or local motion; and this does not
 seem feasible for two reasons. First, because a transformation or an organ
 cannot be effect without a sense of pain. Secondly, because in this case the
 devil would only make things of a known shape appear; but S. Augustine says
 that he creates shapes of this sort, both known and unknown. Therefore it
 seems that the devils can in no way deceive the imagination or senses of a
 man.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>But against this</i>, S. Augustine says (<i>de Ciuitate Dei</i>, XVIII)
 that the transmutations of men into brute animals, said to be done by the art
 of devils, are not actual but only apparent. But this would not be possible
 if devils were not able to transmute the human senses. The authority of
 S. Augustine is again to the point in Book LXXXIII, which has already been
 quoted: This evil of the devil creeps in through all the sensual approaches,
 etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. If the reader wishes to refer to the method of transmutation,
 he will find in the Second Part of this work, chapter VI, various methods.
 But proceeding for the present in a scholastic manner, let us say in
 agreement with the opinions of the three Doctors, that the devil can deceive
 the human fancy so that a man really seems to be an animal. The last of
 those opinions, which is that of S. Thomas, is more subtle than the rest.
 But the first is that of S. Antoninus in the
 first part of his <i>Summa</i>, V, 5, where he declares that the devil at
 times works to deceive a man's fancy, especially by an illusion of the
 senses; and he proves this by natural reasoning, by the authority of the
 Canon, and by a great number of examples.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And at first as follows: Our bodies naturally are subject to and obey the
 angelic nature as regards local motion. But the bad angels, although the
 have lost grace, have not lost their natural power, as has often been said
 before. And since the faculty of fancy or imagination is corporeal, that is,
 allied to a physical organ, it also is naturally subject to devils, so that
 they can transmute it, causing various phantasies, by the flow of the
 thoughts and perceptions to the original image received by them. So says
 S. Antoninus, and adds that it is proved by the following Canon
 (<i>Episcopus</i>, XXVI, 5): It must not be omitted that certain wicked
 women, perverted by Satan and seduced by the illusions and phantasms of
 devils, believe and profess that they ride in the night hours on certain
 beasts with Diana, the heathen goddess, or with Herodias, and with a
 countless number of women, and that in the untimely silence of night they
 travel over great distances of land. And later: Wherefore priests ought to
 preach to the people of God that they should know this to be altogether
 false, and that when such phantasms afflict the minds of the faithful, it
 is not of God, but of an evil spirit. For Satan himself transforms himself
 into the shape and likeness of different persons, and in dreams deluding
 the mind which he holds captive, leads it through devious ways.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Indeed the meaning of this Canon has been treated of in the First Question,
 as to the four things which are to be preached. But it would be to
 misunderstand its meaning to maintain that witches cannot be so transported,
 when they wish and God does not prevent it; for very often men who are not
 witches are unwillingly transported bodily over great distances of land.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But that these transmutations can be effected in both ways will be shown by
 the aforesaid <i>Summa</i>, and in the chapter where S. Augustine relates
 that it is read in the books of the Gentiles that a certain sorceress named
 Circe changed the companions of Ulysses into beasts; but that this was due
 to some glamour or illusion, rather than an actual accomplishment, by
 altering the fancies of men; and this is clearly proved by several examples.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For we read in the <i>Lives of the Fathers</i>, that a certain girl would not
 consent to a young man who was begging her to commit a shameful act with
 him. And the young man, being angry because of this, caused a certain Jew
 to work a charm against her, by which she was changed into a filly. But this
 metamorphosis was not an actual fact, but an illusion of the devil, who
 changed the fancy and sense of the girl herself, and of those who looked at
 her, so that she seemed to be a filly, who was really a girl. For when she
 was led to the Blessed Macarius, the devil could not so work as to deceive
 his senses as he had those of other people, on account of his sanctity;
 for to him she seemed a true girl, not a filly. And at length by his prayer
 she was set free from that illusion, and it is said that this had happened
 to her because she did not give her mind to holy things, or attend the
 Sacraments as she ought; therefore the devil had power over her, although
 she was in other respects honest.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore the devil can, by moving the inner perceptions and humours, effect
 changes in the actions and faculties, physical, mental, and emotional,
 working by means of any physical organ soever; and this accords with S.
 Thomas, I, 91. And of this sort we may believe to have been the acts of
 Simon Magus in the incantations which are narrated of him. But the devil can
 do none of these things without the permission of God, Who with His good
 Angels often restrains the wickedness of him who seeks to deceive and hurt
 us. Wherefore S. Augustine, speaking of witches, says: These are they who,
 with the permission of God, stir up the elements, and confuse the minds of
 those who do not trust in God (XXVI, 5).<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also devils can by witchcraft cause a man to be unable to see his wife
 rightly, and the converse. And this comes from an affectation of the fancy,
 so that she is represented to him as an odious and horrible thing. The devil
 also suggests representations of loathsome things to the fancy of both the
 waking and the sleeping, to deceive them and lead them to son. But because
 sin does not consist in the imagination but in the will, therefore man does
 not sin in these fancies suggested by the devil, and these various
 transformations, unless of his own will he consents to sin.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second opinion of the modern Doctors is to the same effect, when they
 declare what is glamour, and how many ways the devil can cause such
 illusions. Here we refer to what has already been said concerning the
 arguments of S. Antoninus, which there is no need to repeat.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third opinion is that of S. Thomas, and is an answer to the argument
 where it is asked, Wherein lies the existence of the shape of a beast that
 is seen; in the senses, or in reality, or in the surrounding air? And his
 opinion is that the apparent shape of a beast only exists in the inner
 perception, which, through the force of imagination, sees it in some way as
 an exterior object. And the devil has two ways of effecting such a result.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In one way we may say that the forms of animals which are conserved in the
 treasury of the imagination pass by the operation of the devil into the
 organs of inner senses; and in this way it happens in dreams, as has been
 declared above. And so, when these forms are impressed on the organs of the
 outer senses, such as sight, they appear as if they were present as outer
 objects, and could actually be touched.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The other way results from a change in the inner organs of perception,
 through which the judgement is deceived; as is shown in the case of him who
 has his taste corrupted, so that everything sweet seems bitter; and this is
 not very different from the first method. Moreover, even men can accomplish
 this by the virtue of certain natural things, as when in the vapour of a
 certain smoke the beams of a house appear to be serpents; and many other
 instances of this are found, as had been mentioned above.


 <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Solutions of the Arguments.</i></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As to the first argument, that text is often quoted, but it is badly
 understood. For as to where it speaks of transformation into another shape
 or likeness, it has been made clear how this can be done by prestidigitatory
 art. And as to where it says that no creature can be made by the power of
 the devil, this is manifestly true if Made is understood to mean Created.
 But if the word Made is taken to refer to natural production, it is certain
 that devils can make some imperfect creatures. And S. Thomas shows how this
 may be done. For he says that all transmutations of bodily matters which
 can be effected by the forces of nature, in which the essential thing is the
 semen which is found in the elements of this world, on land or in the waters
 (as serpents and frogs and such things deposit their semen), can be effected
 by the work of devils who have acquired such semen. So also it is when
 anything is changed into serpents or frogs, which can be generated by
 putrefaction.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But those transmutations of bodily matters which cannot be effected by the
 forces of nature can in no way be truly effected by the work of the devils.
 For when the body of a man is changed into the body of a beast, or a dead
 body is brought to life, such things only seem to happen, and are a glamour
 or illusion; or else the devil appears before men in an assumed body.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 These arguments are substantiated. For Blessed Albertus in his book <i>On
 Animals</i>, where he examines whether devils, or let us even say witches,
 can really make animals, says that they can, with God's permission, make
 imperfect animals. But they cannot do so in an instant, as God does, but by
 means of some motion, however sudden, as is clear in the case of witches.
 And touching the passage in <i>Exodus</i> vii, where Pharao called his wise
 men, he says: The devils run throughout the world and collect various germs,
 and by using them can evolve various species. And the gloss thereon says:
 When witches attempt to effect anything by the invocation of devils, they
 run about the world and bring the semen of those things which are in
 question, and by its means, with the permission of God, they produce new
 species. But this has been spoken of above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Another difficulty may arise, whether such devils' works are to be deemed
 miraculous. The answer was made clear in the preceding arguments, that even
 the devils can perform certain miracles to which their natural powers are
 adapted. And although such things are true in fact, they are not done with
 a view to the knowledge of the truth; and in this sense the works of
 Antichrist may be said to be deceptions, since they are done with a view to
 the seduction of men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The answer to the other argument, that concerning the shape, is also clear.
 The shape of a beast which is seen does not exist in the air, but only in
 the perception of the senses, as has been demonstrated above from the
 opinion of S. Thomas.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the argument that every passive is set in motion by its corresponding
 active, this is granted. But when it is inferred that the shape which is
 seen cannot be the original object which sets in motion the act of sight,
 since it arises from none of the sense, it is answered that it does not
 arise, since it originates from some sensible image conserved in the
 imagination, which the devil can draw out and present to the imagination or
 power of perception, as has been said above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the last argument, it is to be said that the devil does not, as has been
 shown, change the perceptive and imaginative powers by projecting himself
 into them, but by transmuting them; not indeed by altering them, except in
 respect of local motion. For he cannot of himself induce new appearances,
 as has been said. But he changes them by transmutation, that is, local
 motion. And this again he does, not by dividing the substance of the organ
 of perception, since that would result in a sense of pain, but by a movement
 of the perceptions and humours.<br/>

<h2>Question XI</h2>
<h3>That Witches who are Midwives in Various Ways Kill the Child Conceived in the Womb, and Procure an Abortion; or if they do not this Offer New-born Children to Devils.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here is set forth the truth concerning four horrible crimes which devils
 commit against infants, both in the mother's womb and afterwards. And since
 the devils do these things through the medium of women, and not men, this
 form of homicide is associated rather with women than with men, And the
 following are the methods by which it is done.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The Canonists treat more fully than the Theologians of the obstructions due
 to witchcraft; and they say that is is witchcraft, not only when anyone is
 unable to perform the carnal act, of which we have spoken above; but also
 when a woman is prevented from conceiving, or is made to miscarry after she
 has conceived. A third and fourth method of witchcraft is when they have
 failed to procure an abortion, and then either devour the child or offer it
 to a devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is no doubt concerning the first two methods, since, without the help
 of devils, a man can by natural means, such as herbs, savin for example, or
 other emmenagogues, procure that a woman cannot generate or conceive, as has
 bee mentioned above. But with the other two methods it is different; for
 they are effected by witches. And there is no need to bring forward the
 arguments, since very evident instances and examples will more readily show
 the truth of this matter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The former of these two abominations is the fact that certain witches,
 against the instinct of human nature, and indeed against the nature of all
 beasts, with the possible exception of wolves, are in the habit of devouring
 and eating infant children. And concerning this, the Inquisitor of Como,
 who has been mentioned before, has told us the following: that he was
 summoned by the inhabitants of the County of Barby to hold an inquisition,
 because a certain man had missed his child from its cradle, and finding a
 congress of women in the night-time, swore that he saw them kill his child
 and drink its blood and devour it. Also, in one single year, which is the
 year now last passed, he says that forty-one witches were burned, certain
 others taking flight to the Lord Archduke of Austria, Sigismund. For
 confirmation of this there are certain writings of
 John Nider in his <i>Formicarius</i>, of
 whom, as of those events which he recounts, the memory is still fresh in
 men's minds; wherefore it is apparent that such things are not incredible.
 We must add that in all these matters witch midwives cause yet greater
 injuries, as penitent witches have often told to us and to others, saying:
 No one does more harm to the Catholic Faith than midwives. For when they do
 not kill children, then, as if for some other purpose, they take them out of
 the room and, raising them up in the air, offer them to devils. But the
 method which they observe in crimes of this sort will be shown in the
 Second Part, which we must soon approach. But first one more question must
 be inquired into, namely, that of the Divine permission. For it was said at
 the beginning that three things are necessary for the effecting of
 witchcraft: the devil, a witch, and the Divine permission.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question XII</h2>
<h3>Whether the Permission of Almighty God is an Accompaniment of Witchcraft.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now we must consider the Divine permission itself, touching which four
 things are asked. First, whether it is necessary that this permission should
 accompany a work of witchcraft. Secondly, that God in His justice permits a
 creature naturally sinful to perpetrate witchcraft and other horrid crimes,
 the other two necessary concomitants being presupposed. Thirdly, that the
 crime of witchcraft exceeds all other evils which God permits to be done.
 Fourthly, in what way this matter should be preached to the people.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Concerning the third postulate of this First Part, namely, the Divine
 permission, it is asked: Whether it is as Catholic to affirm the Divine
 permission in these works of witches, as it is quite heretical to contradict
 such an affirmation? And it is argued that it is not heretical to maintain
 that God does not permit so great power to the devil in this sort of
 witchcraft. For it is Catholic, and not heretical, to refute such things as
 appear to be to the disparagement of the Creator. And it is submitted that
 it is Catholic to maintain that the devil is not allowed such power of
 injuring men, since to hold the opposite opinion seems to be a disparagement
 of the Creator. For it would then follow that not everything is subject to
 the Divine providence, since the all-wise Provider keeps away, as far as
 possible, all defect and evil from those for whom He cares. And if the works
 of witchcraft are permitted by God, they are not kept away by Him: and if
 He does not keep them away, the God Himself is not a wise Provider, and all
 things are not subject to His providence. But since this is false, therefore
 it is false that God permits witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again, to permit a thing to happen presupposes in him who permits it
 that either he can prevent it from happening if he wishes, or he cannot
 prevent it even if he wishes; and neither of these suppositions can apply
 to God. For in the first case, such a man would be thought spiteful, and in
 the second case impotent. Then it is incidentally asked: As to that
 bewitchment that happened to Peter, if God could have prevented it, and did
 not do so, then God is either despiteful or He does not care for all; but if
 He could not have prevented it even if He wished, the He is not omnipotent.
 But since it is not possible to maintain the opinion that God does not care
 for all, and the rest, therefore it cannot be said that witchcraft is done
 with the permission of God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, he who is responsible to himself and is the master of his own
 actions is not subject to the permission or providence of any governor. But
 men were made responsible to themselves by God, according to <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>
 xv: God made man from the beginning, and left him in the hand of his counsel.
 In particular, the sins which men do are left in their own counsel, according
 to their hearts' desire. Therefore not all evils are subject to Divine
 permission.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Yet again, S. Augustine says in the <i>Enchiridion</i>, as does also
 Aristotle in the ninth book of <i>Metaphysics:</i> It is better not to know
 certain vile things than to know them, but all that is good is to be
 ascribed to God. Therefore God does not prevent the very vile works of
 witchcraft, whether He permits or not. See also S. Paul in I. <i>Corinthians</i>
 ix: Doth God take care of oxen? And the same holds good of the other
 irrational beasts. Wherefore God takes no care whether they are bewitched or
 not, since they are not subject to His permission, which proceeds from His
 providence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, that which happens of necessity has no need of provident permission
 or prudence. This is clearly shown in Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i>, Book II:
 Prudence is a right reasoning concerning things which happen and are subject
 to counsel and choice. But several effects of witchcraft happen of necessity;
 as when for some reason, or owing to the influence of stars, diseases come,
 or any other things which we judge to be witchcraft. Therefore they are not
 always subject to Divine permission.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again, if men are bewitched by Divine permission, then it is asked: Why
 does this happen to one more than to another? If it be said that it is
 because of sin, which abounds more in one than in another, this does not
 seem valid; for then the greater sinners would be the more bewitched, but
 this is manifestly not so, since they are less punished in this world. As it
 is said: Well is it for the liars. But, if this argument were good, they
 also would be bewitched. Finally, it is clear from the fact that innocent
 children and other just men suffer most from witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But against these arguments: it is submitted that God permits evil to be
 done, though He does not wish it; and this is for the perfecting of the
 universe. See Dionysius, <i>de Diuin. Nom.</i> III: Evil will be for all
 time, even to the perfecting of the universe. And S. Augustine in the
 <i>Enchiridion:</i> In all things good and evil consists the admirable
 beauty of the universe. So that what is said to be evil is well ordained,
 and kept in its due place commends more highly that which is good; for good
 things are more pleasing and laudable when compared with bad. S. Thomas also
 refutes the opinion of those who say that, although God has no wish for evil
 (since no creature seeks for evil, either in its natural, or its animal, or
 in its intellectual appetite, which is the will, whose object is good), yet
 He is willing that evil should exist and be done. This he says to be false;
 since God neither wishes evil to be done, nor wishes it not to be done, but
 is willing to allow evil to be done; and this is good for the perfecting of
 the universe.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And why it is erroneous to say that God wishes evil to be and to be done,
 for the good of the universe, he says is for the following reason. Nothing
 is to be judged good except what is good in itself and not by accident. As
 the virtuous man is judge good in his intellectual nature, not in his animal
 nature. But evil is not of itself ordained for good, but by accident. For
 against the intention of those who do evil, good results. In this way,
 against the intention of witches, or against the intention of tyrants, was
 it that through their persecutions the patience of the martyrs shone out
 clearly.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. This question is as difficult to understand as it is
 profitable to elucidate. For there is among the arguments, not so much of
 Laymen as of certain Wise men, this in common; that they do not believe that
 such horrible witchcraft as had been spoken of is permitted by God; being
 ignorant of the causes of this Divine permission. And by reason of this
 ignorance, since witches are not put down with the vengeance that is due to
 them, they seem now to be depopulating the whole of Christianity. Therefore
 that both learned and unlearned may be satisfied in each way, according to
 the opinion of the Theologians, we make our answer by the discussion of two
 difficulties. And first, that he world is so subject to the Divine providence
 that He Himself provides for all. Secondly, that in His justice He permits
 the prevalence of sin, which consists of guilt, punishment, and loss, by
 reason of His two first permissions, namely, the fall of the Angels and that
 of our first parents. From which also it will be clear that obstinately to
 disbelieve this smacks of heresy, since such a man implicates himself in the
 errors of the infidels.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as for the first, it is to be noted that, presupposing that which pertains
 to the providence of God (see <i>Wisdom</i> xiv: Thy providence, O Father,
 governeth all things), we ought also to maintain that all things are subject
 to His providence, and that also He immediately provides for all things. And
 to make this clear, let us first refute a certain contrary error. For taking
 the text in <i>Job</i> xxii: Thick clouds are a covering to him that He
 seeth not us; and He walketh in the circuit of heaven: some have thought that
 the doctrine pf S. Thomas, I, 22, means that only incorruptible things are
 subject to Divine providence, such as the separate Essences, and the stars,
 with also the species of lower things, which are also incorruptible; but
 they said that the individuals of the species, being corruptible, were not
 so subject. Wherefore they said that all lower things which are in the world
 are subject to Divine providence in the universal, but not in the particular
 or individual sense. But to others this opinion did not seem tenable, since
 God cares for the other animals just as He does for men. Therefore the Rabbi
 Moses, wishing to hold a middle course, agreed with their opinion in saying
 that all corruptible things are not individually entirely subject to Divine
 governance, but only in a universal sense, as has been said before; but he
 excepted men from the generality of corruptible things, because of the
 splendid nature of their intellect, which is comparable with the of the
 separate Essences. And so, according to his opinion, whatever witchcraft
 happens to men comes from the Divine permission; but not such as happens to
 the animals or to the other fruits of the earth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now though this opinion is nearer to the truth than that which altogether
 denies the providence of God in worldly matters, maintaining that the world
 was made by chance, as did Democritus and the Epicureans, yet it is not
 without great fallacy. For it must be said that everything is subject to
 Divine providence, not only in the general, but also in the particular sense;
 and that the bewitching not only of men, but also of animals and the fruits
 of the earth, comes from Divine and provident permission. And this is
 plainly true; the providence and ordinance of things to some end extend just
 so far as the causality of them itself extends. To take an example from
 things that are subject to some master; they are so far subject to his
 providence as they are themselves under his control. But the causality which
 is of God is the original agent, and extends itself to all beings, not only
 in a general but also in an individual sense, and not only to things
 incorruptible. Therefore, since all things must be of God, so all things are
 cared for by Him, that is, are ordained to some end.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This point is touched by S. Paul in <i>Romans</i> xiii: All things which are
 from God were ordained by Him. Which is to say that, just as all things come
 from God, so also are all things ordained by Him, and are consequently
 subject to His providence. For the providence of God is to be understood as
 nothing else than the reason, that is, the cause of the ordering of things
 to a purpose. Therefore, in so far as all things are a part of one purpose,
 so also are they subject to the providence of God. And God knows all things,
 not only in the mass generally, but also in the individual particularly. Now
 the knowledge which God has of things created is to be compared with a
 craftsman's knowledge of his work: therefore, just as all his work is subject
 to the order and providence of a craftsman, so are all things subject to the
 order and providence of God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But this does not provide a satisfactory explanation of the fact that God in
 justice permits evil and witchcraft to be in the world, although He is
 Himself the provider and governor of all things; for it would seem that, if
 this is conceded, He ought to keep away all evil from those for whom He
 cares. For we see among men that a wise provider does all that he can to
 keep away all defect and harm from those who are his care; therefore why
 does not God, in the same way, keep away all evil? It must be noted that a
 particular and an universal controller or provider are two very different
 matters. For the particular controller must of necessity keep away all the
 harm he can, since he is not able to extract good out of evil. But God is
 the universal controller of the whole world, and can extract much good from
 particular evils; as through the persecution of the tyrants came the patience
 of the martyrs, and through the works of witches come the purgation or
 proving of the faith of the just, as will be shown. Therefore it is not God's
 purpose to prevent all evil, lest the universe should lack the cause of
 much good. Wherefore S. Augustine says in the <i>Enchiridion:</i> So
 merciful is Almighty God, that He would not allow any evil to be in His
 works unless He were so omnipotent and good that He can bring good even out
 of evil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we have an example of this in the actions of natural things. For
 although the corruptions and defects which occur in natural things are
 contrary to the purpose of that particular thing (as when a thief is hanged,
 or when animals are killed for human food), they are yet in accordance with
 the universal purpose of nature (as that man's life and property should be
 kept intact); and thus the universal good is preserved. For it is necessary
 for the conservation of the species that the death of one should be the
 preservation of another. For lions are kept alive by the slaughter of other
 animals.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question XIII</h2>
<h3>Herein is set forth the Question, concerning the Two Divine Permissions which God justly allows, namely, that the Devil, the Author or all Evil, should Sin, and that our First Parents should Fall, from which Origins the Works of Witches are justly suffered to take place.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second question and proposition is that God justly permitted certain
 Angels to sin in deed, which He could not have allowed unless they were
 capable of sin; and that in like manner He preserved certain creatures
 through grace, without their having previously suffered temptation; and that
 He justly allows man both to be tempted and to sin. And all this is clearly
 shown as follows. For it is a part of Divine providence that each single
 thing should be left to its own nature, and not be altogether impeded in its
 natural works. For, as Dionysius says (<i>de Diuin. Nom.</i>, IV), Providence
 is not a destroyer, but a preserver of nature. This being so, it is manifest
 that, just as the good of the race is better than the good of the individual
 (Aristotle, <i>Ethics</i>, I), so also the good of the universe takes
 precedence over the good of any particular creature. Therefore we must add
 that, if men were prevented from sinning, many steps to perfection would be
 removed. For that nature would be removed which has it in its power to sin
 or not to sin; but it has already been shown that this is a natural property
 of man's nature.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And let it be answered that, if there had been no sin, but immediate
 confirmation, then there would never have appeared what debt of grace in
 good works is due to God, and what the power of sin has been able to effect,
 and many other things without which the universe would suffer great loss.
 For it behoved that Satan should sin, not through some outside suggestion,
 but that he should find in himself the occasion of sin. And this he did when
 he wished to be equal to God. Now this is to be understood neither simply
 and directly, nor indirectly, but only with a reservation; and this is
 declared according to the authority of <i>Esaias</i> xiv: I will ascend above
 the heights of the clouds; I will be like the Most High. For it must not be
 understood simply and directly, because in that case he would have had a
 limited and erring understanding, in seeking something which was impossible
 for him. For he knew that he was a creature created by God, and therefore
 he knew that it was impossible for him to become equal to his Creator.
 Neither, again, must it be understood indirectly; for since the whole
 transparence of the air consists in its subjection to the sun's rays;
 therefore nothing which would be contrary to the good of its nature could be
 sought for by an Angel. But he sought for equality with God, not absolutely,
 but with a reservation, which was as follows. The nature of God has two
 qualities, that of blessedness and goodness, and the fact that all the
 blessedness and goodness of His creatures issues from Him. Therefore the
 Angel, seeing that the dignity of his own nature transcended that of the
 other creatures, wished and asked that the blessedness and goodness of all
 the inferior creatures should be derived from him. And he sought this in his
 own natural capacity, that just as he was the first to be endowed in nature
 with those qualities, so the other creatures should receive them from the
 nobility of his nature. And he sought this of God, in perfect willingness to
 remain subject to God so long as he had that power granted to him. Therefore
 he did not wish to be made equal with God absolutely, but only with a
 reservation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is further to be noted that, wishing to bring his desire to the point of
 action, he suddenly made it known to others; and the understanding of the
 other Angels of his desire, and their perverse consenting to it, was also
 sudden. Therefore the sin of the First Angel exceeded and preceded the sins
 of the others in respect of the magnitude of his guilt and causality, but
 not in respect of duration. See <i>Apocalypse</i> xii. The dragon falling
 from heaven drew with him the third part of the stars. And he lives in the
 form of Leviathan, and is king over all the children or pride. And,
 according to Aristotle (<i>Metaph.</i>, V), he is called king of princes,
 inasmuch as he moves those who are subject to him according to his will and
 command. Therefore his sin was the occasion of sin in others, since he first,
 not having been tempted from outside, was the external temptation of others.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And that all these things happened instantaneously may be exemplified by
 physical things; for the ignition of a gas, the sight of the flame, and the
 impression formed by that sight all happen at one and the same time.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I have put this matter at some length; for in the consideration of that
 stupendous Divine permission in the case of the most noble creatures with
 regard to the one sin of ambition, it will be easier to admit particular
 permissions in the case of the works of witches, which are in some certain
 circumstances even greater sins. For in certain circumstances the sins of
 witches are greater than that of the Angel or of our first parents, as will
 be shown in the Second Part.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the fact that the providence of God permitted the first man to be
 tempted and to sin is sufficiently clear from what has been said concerning
 the transgression of the Angels. For both man and the Angel were created
 to the same end, and left with free-will, in order that they might receive
 the reward of blessedness not without merit. Therefore, just as the Angel
 was not preserved from his fall, in order that the power of sin on the one
 side and the power of the confirmation of grace on the other side might work
 together for the glory of the universe, so also ought it to be considered in
 the case of man.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore S. Thomas (II, 23, art. 2) says: That by which God is glorified
 ought not to be hindered from within. But God is glorified in sin, when He
 pardons in mercy and when He punishes in justice; therefore it behoves Him
 not to hinder sin. Let us, then, return to a brief recapitulation of our
 proposition, namely, that by the just providence of God man is permitted to
 sin for many reasons. First, that the power of God may be shown, Who alone
 is unchanging while every creature is variable. Secondly, that the wisdom of
 God may be declared, Who can bring good out of evil, which could not be
 unless God had allowed the creature to sin. Thirdly, that the mercy of God
 may be made manifest, by which Christ through His death liberated man who
 was lost. Fourthly, that the justice of God may be shown, which not only
 rewards the good, but also punishes the wicked. Fifthly, that the condition
 of man may not be worse than that of other creatures, all of whom God so
 governs that He allows them to act after their own nature; wherefore it
 behoved Him to leave man to his own judgement. Sixthly, for the glory of
 men; that is, the glory of the just man who could transgress but has not. And
 seventhly, for the adorning of the universe; for as there is a threefold
 evil in sin, namely, guilty, pain, and loss, so is the universe adorned by
 the corresponding threefold good, namely, righteousness, pleasure, and
 usefulness. For righteousness is adorned by guilt, pleasure by pain, and all
 usefullness by loss. And by this the answer to the arguments is made plain.


 <div style="text-align: center;"><i>Solutions to the Arguments.</i></div>



  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 According to the first argument it is heretical to maintain that the devil
 is allowed power to injure men. But the opposite appears rather to be true;
 for it is heretical to assert that God does not permit man, of his own
 free-will, to sin when he wishes. And God permits much sin, by reason of
 His power to hurt men in the punishment of the wicked for the adorning of
 the universe. For it is said by S. Augustine in his <i>Book of Soliloques:</i>
 Thou, Lord, hast commanded, and it is so, that the shame of guilt should
 never be without the glory of punishment.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And that is not a valid proof of the argument which is taken from the wise
 ruler who keeps away all defect and evil as far as he can. For it is quite
 different with God, Who has an universal care, from one who has only a
 particular care. For God, Whose care is universal, can bring good out of
 evil, as is shown by what has been said.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the second argument, it is clear that God's power as well as His
 goodness and justice are manifest in His permission of sin. So when it is
 argued that God either can or cannot prevent evil, the answer is that He
 can prevent it, but that for the reasons already shown it does not behove
 Him to do so.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Neither is it valid to object that He therefore wishes evil to be; since He
 can prevent it but will not; for, as has been shown in the arguments for the
 truth, God cannot wish evil to be. He neither wishes nor does not wish it,
 but He permits it for the perfecting of the universe.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the third argument S. Augustine and Aristotle are quoted on the subject
 of human knowledge, saying that it is better for a man not to have knowledge
 of that which is evil and vile for two reasons: first, that then he will
 have less opportunity to think of evil, since we cannot understand many
 things at the same time. And secondly, because knowledge of evil sometimes
 perverts the will towards evil. But these arguments do not concern God, Who
 without and detriment understands all the deeds of men and of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the fourth argument: S. Paul excepts the care of God from oxen, to show
 that a rational creature has through free-will command over its actions, as
 has been said. Therefore God has a special providence over him, that either
 blame or merit may be imputed to him, and he may receive either punishment
 or reward; but that God does not in this way care for the irrational beasts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But to argue from that authority that the individuals of irrational creation
 have no part in Divine providence would be heretical; for it would be to
 maintain that all things are not subject to Divine providence, and would be
 contrary to the praise which is spoken in Holy Scripture concerning the
 Divine wisdom, which stretches mightily from end to end and disposes all
 things well; and it would be the error of the Rabbi Moses as was shown in
 the arguments for the truth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the fifth argument, man did not institute nature, but puts the works of
 nature to the greatest use known to his skill and strength. Therefore human
 providence does not extend to the inevitable phenomena of nature, as that
 the sun will rise to-morrow. But God's providence does extend to these
 things, since He is Himself the author of nature. Wherefore also defects in
 nature, even if they arise out of the natural course of things, are subject
 to Divine providence. And therefore Democritus and the other natural
 philosophers were in error when they ascribed whatever happened to the
 inferior creation to the mere chance of matter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the last argument: although every punishment is inflicted by God for sin,
 yet the greatest sinners are not always afflicted with witchcraft. And this
 may be because the devil does not wish to afflict and tempt those whom he
 sees to belong to him by just title, or because he does not wish them to be
 turned back to God. As it is said: Their plagues were multiplied, and they
 turned them to God, etc. And that all punishment is inflicted by God for sin
 is shown by what follows; for according to S. Jerome: Whatever we suffer, we
 deserve for our sins.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now it is declared that the sins of witches are more grievous than those of
 the bad angels and our first parents. Wherefore, just as the innocent are
 punished for the sins of their fathers, so are many blameless people damned
 and bewitched for the sins of witches.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question XIV</h2>
<h3>The Enormity of Witches is Considered, and it is shown that the Whole Matter should be rightly Set Forth and Declared.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Concerning the enormity of crimes, it is asked whether the crimes of witches
 exceed, both in guilt, in pain, and in loss, all the evils which God allows
 and has permitted from the beginning of the world up till now. And it seems
 that they do not, especially as regards guilt. For the sin which a man
 commits when he could easily avoid it is greater than the sin which another
 man commits when he could not so easily avoid it. This is shown by S.
 Augustine, <i>de Ciuit. Dei</i>: There is great wickedness in sinning when
 it is so easy not to sin. But Adam, and others who have sinned when in a
 state of perfection or even of grace, could more easily because of the help
 of grace have avoided their sins — especially Adam who was created in grace
 — than many witches, who have not shared in such gifts. Therefore the sins
 of such are greater than all the crimes of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again in respect of punishment: the greatest punishment is due to the
 greater blame. But Adam's sin was the most heavily punished, as is plainly
 proved by the fact that both his guilt and his punishment are shown in all
 his posterity by the inheritance of original sin. Therefore his sin is
 greater than all other sins.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again, the same is argued in respect of loss. For according to S.
 Augustine: A thing is evil in that it takes away from the good; therefore
 where there is the more good lost, there the greater evil has gone before.
 But the sin of our first parent brought the greatest loss both to nature and
 to grace, since it deprived us of innocence and immortality; and no
 subsequent sin has brought such loss, therefore, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the contrary side: that which includes the most causes of evil is the
 greater evil, and such are the sins of witches. For they can, with God's
 permission, bring every evil upon that which is good by nature and in form,
 as is declared in the Papal Bull. Besides, Adam sinned only in doing that
 which was wrong in one of two ways; for it was forbidden, but was not wrong
 in itself: but witches and other sinners sin in doing that which is wrong
 in both ways, wrong in itself, and forbidden, such as murders and many other
 forbidden things. Therefore their sins are heavier than other sins.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, sin which comes from definite malice is heavier than sin which
 comes from ignorance. But witches, out of great malice, despise the Faith
 and the sacraments of the Faith, as many of them have confessed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. The evils which are perpetrated by modern witches exceed all
 other sin which God has ever permitted to be done, as was said in the title
 of this Question. And this can be shown in three ways, in so far as they are
 sins involving perversity of character, though it is different with the sins
 that contravene the other Theological virtues. First in general, by
 comparing their works indifferently with any other worldly crimes. Secondly
 in particular, by considering the species of the superstition and into what
 pact they have entered with the devil. And thirdly, by comparing their sins
 with the sins of the bad Angels and even with that of our first parents.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And first, sin is threefold, involving guilt, punishment, and loss. Good
 also is correspondingly threefold, involving righteousness, felicity, and
 use. And righteousness corresponds with the guilt, felicity with punishment,
 and use with loss.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 That the guilt of witches exceeds all other sins is apparent in this way.
 For according to the teaching of S. Thomas (II, 22, art. 2), there is in the
 matter of sin much that may be considered whereby the gravity or lightness
 of the sin may be deduced; and the same sin may be found heavy in one and
 light in another. For example, we can say that in fornication a young man
 sins, but an old man is mad. Yet those sins are, simply speaking, the heavier
 which are not only attended by the more extensive and more powerful
 circumstances, but are in their nature and quantity of a more essentially
 serious sort.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And so we can say that, though the sin of Adam was in some respects heavier
 than all other sins, inasmuch as he fell to the instigation of a smaller
 temptation, since it came only from within; and also because he could more
 easily have resisted on account of the original justice in which he was
 created: nevertheless in the form and quantity of sin, and in other respects
 which aggravate the sin the more in that it is the cause of many yet
 heavier sins, the sins of witches exceed all other sins. And this will be
 made still clearer in two ways.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For one sin is said to be greater than another in one or other of the
 following respects: in causality, as was the sin of Lucifer; in generality,
 as Adam's sin; in hideousness, as was the sin of Judas; in the difficulty
 of forgiving it, as is the sin against the Holy Ghost; in danger, as in the
 sin of covetousness; in inclination, as is the sin of the flesh; in the
 offending of the Divine Majesty, as is the sin of idolatry and infidelity;
 in the difficulty of combating it, as the sin of pride; in blindness of mind,
 as the sin of anger. Accordingly, after the sin of Lucifer, the works of
 witches exceed all other sins, in hideousness since they deny Him crucified,
 in inclination since the commit nastiness of the flesh with devils, in
 blindness of mind since in a pure spirit of malignity the rage and bring
 every injury upon the souls and bodies of men and beasts, as has been shown
 from what has been said before.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this, indeed, is indicated, according to S. Isidore, by the word. For
 they are called witches (<i>maleficae</i>) on account of the enormity of
 their crimes, as has been said above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Our contention is also deduced from the following. There are two gradations
 in sin, a turning away, and a change of heart. See our quotation from S.
 Augustine: Sin is to reject the incommutable good, and to cleave to things
 that are variable. And the turning away from God is as it were formal, just
 as the change of heart is as it were material. Therefore the more a man is
 separated from God by it, the heavier is the sin. And since infidelity is
 the chief cause of man's separation from God, the infidelity of witches
 stands out as the greatest of sins. And this is given the name of Heresy,
 which is Apostasy from the Faith; and in this witches sin throughout their
 whole lives.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the sin of infidelity consists in opposing the Faith; and this may come
 about in two ways, by opposing a faith which has not yet been received, or
 by opposing it after it has been received. Of the first sort is the
 infidelity of the Pagans or Gentiles. In the second way, the Christian Faith
 may be denied in two ways: either by denying the prophecies concerning it,
 or by denying the actual manifestation of its truth. And the first of these
 is the infidelity of the Jews, and the second the infidelity of Heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is clear from this that the heresy of witches is the most heinous of the
 three degrees of infidelity; and this fact is proved both by reason and
 authority. For it is said in II. S. <i>Peter</i> ii: It has been better for
 them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known
 it, to turn from it. And it is reasonable to suppose that, just as he who
 does not perform what he has promised commits a greater sin than he who does
 not perform what he never promised, so the infidelity of the heretics, who
 while professing the faith of the Gospel fight against it by corrupting it,
 is a greater sin than that of the Jews and Pagans.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again, the Jews sin more greatly than the Pagans; for they received the
 prophecy of the Christian Faith in the Old Law, which they corrupt through
 badly interpreting it, which is not the case with the Pagans. Therefore
 their infidelity is a greater sin than that of the Gentiles, who never
 received the Faith of the Gospel. But concerning Apostasy, S. Thomas says in
 the <i>Second of the Second</i>, question 12: Apostasy means a turning away
 from God and religion, and this may happen according to the different ways
 by which man is joined to God; that is, by faith, or by the subjection of
 the will to obedience, or by religion and Holy Orders. S. Raymund and
 Hostiensis say that Apostasy is a rash departure from the state of faith or
 obedience or Religion. Now if that which precedes is removed, that which
 follows from it is also removed; but the converse proposition is not true.
 Therefore Apostasy from the Faith is a greater sin than the other two forms
 of infidelity, since in its case a precedent Religion has been removed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But according to S. Raymund, a man is not to be judged an Apostate or
 deserter, however far and long he may have strayed, unless he shows by his
 subsequent life that he has not though of returning to the Faith. And this
 would be shown in the case of a cleric if he were to marry a wife, or commit
 some similar crime. In the same way it is an Apostasy of disobedience when
 a man wilfully spurns the teaching of the Church and the Bishops. And such a
 man must be convicted of his infamy, and be excommunicated.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now when we speak of the Apostasy of witches, we mean the Apostasy of
 perfidy; and this is so much the more heinous, in that it springs from a pact
 made with the enemy of the Faith and the way of salvation. For witches are
 bound to make this pact, which is exacted by that enemy either in part or
 wholly. For we Inquisitors have found some witches who have denied all the
 articles of Faith, and others who have denied only a certain number of them;
 but they are all bound to deny true and sacramental confession. And so, even
 the Apostasy of Julian does not seem to have been so great, although in
 other respects he did more harm against the Church; but we cannot speak of
 that here.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be incidentally objected that it is possible that they may keep
 the Faith in the thoughts of their hearts, which God alone, and not even
 any Angel, can see into; but do reverence and obedience to the devil only
 in outward form. The answer to this seems to be that there are two degrees
 of the Apostasy of perfidy. One consists in outward acts of infidelity,
 without the formation of any pact with the devil, as when one lives in the
 lands of the infidels and conforms his life to that of the Mohammedans. The
 other consists in a pact made with the devil by one who lives in Christian
 lands, In the first case, men who keep the Faith in their hearts but deny it
 in their outward acts, though they are not Apostates or Heretics, are guilty
 of deadly sin. For in this way Solomon showed reverence to the gods of his
 wives. And no one can be excused on the ground that he does this through
 fear; for S. Augustine says: It is better to die of hunger than to be fed by
 Idolaters. But however much witches may retain the Faith in their hearts
 while denying it with their lips, they are still to be judged Apostates,
 since they have made a treaty with death and a compact with hell. Wherefore
 S. Thomas (II, 4), speaking of such magic works, and of those who in any way
 seek help from devils, says: They are all Apostates from the Faith, by reason
 of a pact made with the Devil, either in word, when some invocation is used,
 or by some deed, even if there is no actual sacrifice. For no man can serve
 two masters.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To the same effect writes Blessed Albertus Magnus, where he asks whether
 the sin of Magicians and Astrologers is an Apostasy from the Faith. And he
 answers: In such there is always Apostasy either of word or of deed. For if
 any invocations are made, then there is an open pact made with the devil,
 and it is plainly Apostasy in word. But if their magic is simply a matter
 of action, then it is Apostasy in deed. And since in all these there is
 abuse of the Faith, seeing that they look for from the devil what they
 ought to look for from God, therefore they are always to be judged Apostates.
 See how clearly they set forth two degrees of Apostasy, understanding a
 third, namely, that of thought. And even if this last is lacking, yet
 witches are judged to be Apostates in word and deed. Therefore, as will be
 shown, they must be subject to the punishment of Heretics and Apostates.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there is in them a third enormity of crime, exceeding all other heresies.
 For S. Augustine (XXVIII, 1 and 2) tells us that the whole life of infidels
 is a sin; and the gloss on <i>Romans</i> xiv says that everything which
 comes not of faith is sin. What then is to be thought of the whole life of
 witches, that is, of all their other actions which are not pleasing to the
 devil, such as fasting, attending church, communicating, and other things?
 For in all these things they commit deadly sin, as is shown as follows. So
 far have they fallen in sin that, although they have not lost all power of
 amendment (since sin does not corrupt the whole good of their nature, and a
 natural light yet remains in them); yet, because of their homage given to
 the devil, and unless they be absolved from it, all their works, even when
 they appear to be good, are rather of an evil nature. And this is not seen
 to be the case with other infidels.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For according to S. Thomas in the <i>Second of the Second</i>, question 10,
 Whether every action of an infidel is a sin; he says that the deeds of the
 unfaithful which are, of themselves, good, such as fasting, almsgiving, and
 deeds of that sort, are no merit to them because of their infidelity, which
 is a most grievous sin. Yet sin does not corrupt the whole good of their
 nature, and there remains in them a natural light. Therefore not ever deed
 of theirs is mortal sin, but only those which proceed from their very
 infidelity, or are related to it. For example, a Saracen fasts, to observe
 the law of Mohammed as to fasting, and a Jew observes his Feast days; but in
 such things he is guilty of mortal sin. And in this way is to be understood
 the above dictum of S. Augustine, that the whole life of infidels is sin.


 <div style="text-align: center;"><i>That Witches Deserve the heaviest Punishment above All the
 Criminals of the World.</i></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The crimes of witches, then, exceed the sins of all others; and we now
 declare what punishment they deserve, whether as Heretics or as Apostates.
 Now Heretics, according to S. Raymund, are punished in various ways, as by
 excommunication, deposition, confiscation of their goods, and death. The
 reader can be fully informed concerning all these by consulting the law
 relating to the sentence of excommunication. Indeed even their followers,
 protectors, patrons and defenders incur the heaviest penalties. For, besides
 the punishment of excommunication inflicted upon them, Heretics, together
 with their patrons, protectors and defenders, and with their children to the
 second generation on the father's side, and to the first degree on the
 mother's side, are admitted to no benefit or office of the Church. And if a
 Heretic have Catholic children, for the heinousness of his crime they are
 deprived of their paternal inheritance. And if a man be convicted, and
 refuse to be converted and abjure his heresy, he must at once be burned, if
 he is a layman. For if they who counterfeit money are summarily put to death,
 how much more must they who counterfeit the Faith? But if he is a cleric,
 after solemn degradation he is handed over to the secular Court to be put to
 death. But if they return to the Faith, they are to be imprisoned for life.
 But in practice they are treated more leniently after recantation than they
 should be according to the judgement of the Bishops and Inquisition, as will
 be shown in the Third Part, where the various methods of sentencing such are
 treated of; that is to say, those who are arrested and convicted and have
 recanted their error.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But to punish witches in these ways does not seem sufficient, since they are
 not simple Heretics, but Apostates. More than this, in their very apostasy
 they do not deny the Faith for any fear of men or for any delight of the
 flesh, as has been said before; but, apart from their abnegation, even give
 homage to the very devils by offering them their bodies and souls. Is is
 clear enough from this that, however much they are penitent and return to
 the Faith, they must not be punished like other Heretics with lifelong
 imprisonment, but must be made to suffer the extreme penalty. And because of
 the temporal injury which they do to men and beasts in various ways, the
 laws demand this. Is is even equally culpable to learn as it is to teach
 such iniquities, say the laws concerning Soothsayers. Then how much more
 emphatically do they speak concerning witches, where they say that the
 penalty for them is the confiscation of their goods and decapitation. The
 laws also say much concerning those who by witchcraft provoke a woman to
 lust, or, conversely, cohabit with beasts. But these matters were touched
 upon on the First Question.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question XV</h2>
<h3>It is Shown that, on Account of the Sins of Witches, the Innocent are often Bewitched, yea, Sometimes even for their Own Sins.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is a fact that, by Divine permission, many innocent people suffer loss
 and are punished by the aforesaid plagues, not for their own sins, but for
 those of witches. And lest this should seem to any a paradox, S. Thomas
 shows in the <i>Second of the Second</i>, quest. 8, that this is just in
 God. For he divides the punishments of this life into three classes. First,
 one man belongs to another; therefore, if a man be punished in his
 possessions, it may be that another man suffers for this punishment. For,
 bodily speaking, sons are a property of the father, and slaves and animals
 are the property of their masters; and so the sons are sometimes punished
 for their parents. Thus the son born to David from adultery quickly died;
 and the animals of the Amalekites were bidden to be killed. Yet the reason
 for these things remains a mystery.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, the sin of one may be passed on to another; and this in two ways.
 By imitation, as children imitate the sins of their parents, and slaves and
 dependents the sins of their masters, that they may sin more boldly. In
 this way the sons inherit ill-gotten gain, and slaves share in robberies and
 unjust feuds, in which they are often killed. And they who are subject to
 Governors sin the more boldly when they see them sin, even if they do not
 commit the same sins; wherefore they are justly punished.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also the sin of one is passed on to another in the way of desert, as when
 the sins of wicked subjects are passed on to a bad Governor, because the
 sins of the subjects deserve a bad Governor. See <i>Job</i>: He makes
 Hypocrites to reign on account of the sins of the people.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Sin, and consequently punishment, can also be passed on through some consent
 or dissimulation. For when those in authority neglect to reprove sin, then
 very often the good are punished with the wicked, as S. Augustine says in
 the first book <i>de Ciuitate Dei</i>. An example was brought to our notice
 as Inquisitors. A town was once rendered almost destitute by the death of
 its citizens; and there was a rumour that a certain buried woman was
 gradually eating the shroud in which she had been buried, and that the
 plague could not cease until she had eaten the whole shroud and absorbed it
 into her stomach. A council was held, and the Podesta with the Governor of
 the city dug up the grave, and found half the shroud absorbed through the
 mouth and throat into the stomach, and consumed. In horror at this sight,
 the Podesta drew his sword and cut off her head and threw it out of the
 grave, and at once the plague ceased. Now the sins of that old woman were,
 by Divine permission, visited upon the innocent on account of the
 dissimulation of what had happened before. For when an Inquisition was held
 it was found that during a long time of her life she had been a Sorceress
 and Enchantress. Another example is the punishment of a pestilence because
 David numbered the people.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, sin is passed on by Divine permission in commendation of the unity
 of human society, that one man should take care for another by refraining
 from sin; and also to make sin appear the more detestable, in that the sin
 of one redounds upon all, as though all were one body. An example is the sin
 of Achan in <i>Joshua</i> vii.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We can add to these two other methods: that the wicked are punished sometimes
 by the good, and sometimes by other wicked men. For as Gratianus says
 (XXIII, 5), sometimes God punishes the wicked through those who are
 exercising their legitimate power at His command; and this in two ways:
 sometimes with merit on the part of the punishers, as when He punished the
 sins of the Canaanites through His people; sometimes with no merit on the
 part of the punishers, but even to their own punishment, as when He punished
 the tribe of Benjamin and destroyed it except for a few men. And sometimes
 He punishes by His nations being aroused, either by command or permission,
 but with no intention of obeying God, but rather greedy for their own gain,
 and therefore to their own damnation; as He now punished His people by the
 Turks, and did so more often by strange nations in the Old Law.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it must be noted that for whatever cause a man be punished, if he does
 not bear his pains patiently, then it becomes a scourge, not a correction,
 but only of vengeance, that is, of punishment. See <i>Deuteronomy</i> xxxii:
 A fire is kindled in min anger (that is, my punishment; for there is no
 other anger in God), and shall burn unto the lowest hell (that is,
 vengeance shall begin here and burn unto the last damnation, as S. Augustine
 explains), And there is further authority concerning punishment in his
 Fourth Distinction. But if men patiently bear their scourges, and are patient
 in the state of grace, they take the place of a correction, as S. Thomas
 says in his Fourth Book. And this is true even of one punished for committing
 witchcraft, or of a witch, to a greater or less degree according to the
 devotion of the sufferer and the quality of his crime.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the natural death of the body, being the last terror, is not a
 correction, since of its nature it partakes in the punishment for original
 sin. Nevertheless, according to Scotus, when it is awaited with resignation
 and devotion, and offered in its bitterness to God, it can in some way
 become a correction. But violent death, whether a man deserves it or not, is
 always a correction, if it is borne patiently and in grace. So much for
 punishments inflicted on account of the sins of others.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But God also punishes men in this life for their own sins, especially in the
 matter of bewitchment. For see <i>Tobias</i> vii: The devil has power over
 those who follow their lusts. And this is clear from what we have already
 said concerning the member and the genital powers, which God chiefly allows
 to be bewitched.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 However, for the purpose of preaching to the public it is to be noted that,
 notwithstanding the aforesaid punishments which God inflicts on men for
 their own and others' sins, the preacher should keep as his basic principle
 and to the people this ruling of the law; which says, No one must be
 punished without guilt, unless there is some cause for doing so. And this
 ruling holds good in the Court of Heaven, that is, of God, just as it does
 in the human Courts of Justice, whether secular or ecclesiastic.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The preacher may predicate this of the Court of Heaven. For the punishment
 of God is of two kinds, spiritual and temporal. In the former, punishment is
 never found without guilt. In the latter it is sometimes found quite without
 guilt, but not without cause. The first, or spiritual punishment, is of
 three kinds; the first being forfeiture of grace and a consequent hardening
 in sin, which is never inflicted except for the sufferer's own guilt. The
 second is the punishment of loss, that is, deprivation of glory, which is
 never inflicted without personal guilt in adults, or contracted guilt in
 children born from their parents' sin. The third is the punishment of pain,
 that is, the torture of hell fire, and is plainly due to guilt. Wherefore
 when it is said in <i>Exodus</i> xx: I am a jealous God, visiting the sins
 of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation: it is
 understood as speaking of the imitators of their fathers' crimes, as Gratian
 has explained, Book I, quest. 4; where he also gives other expositions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now with regard to God's second, or temporal punishment: first, it may be,
 as has been said before, for the sin of another (but not without cause), or
 for personal guilt only, without any other's sin. But if you wish to know
 the causes for which God punishes, and even without any guilt of the
 sufferer or of another man, you may refer to the five methods which the
 Master expounds in Book IV, dist. 15, cap. 2. And you must take the three
 first causes, for the other two refer to personal guilt.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For he says that for five causes God scourges man in this life, or inflicts
 punishment. First, that God may be glorified; and this is when some
 punishment or affliction is miraculously removed, as in the case of the man
 born blind (<i>S. John</i> ix), or of the raising of Lazarus (<i>S. John</i>
 xi).<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, if the first cause is absent, it is sent that merit may be acquired
 through the exercise of patience, and also that inner hidden virtue may be
 made manifest to others. Examples are <i>Job</i> i and <i>Tobias</i> ii.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly that virtue may be preserved through the humiliation of castigation.
 S. Paul is an example, who says of himself in II. <i>Corinthians</i> xii:
 There was given unto me a thorn in my flesh, the messenger of Satan. And
 according to Remigius this thorn was the infirmity of carnal desire. These
 are the cause that are without guilt in the sufferer.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fourthly, that eternal damnation should begin in this life, that it might be
 in some way shown what will be suffered in hell. Examples are Herod (<i>Acts</i>
 xii) and Antiochus (II. <i>Maccabees</i> ix).<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fifthly, that man may be purified, by the expulsion and obliteration of his
 guilt through scourges. Examples may be taken from Miriam, Aaron's sister,
 who was stricken with leprosy, and from the Israelites wandering in the
 wilderness, according to S. Jerome, XXIII, 4. Or it may be for the correction
 of sin, as is exemplified by the case of David, who, after being pardoned
 for his adultery, was driven from his kingdom, as is shown in II. <i>Kings</i>,
 and is commented on by S. Gregory in his discourse on sin. It may, in fact,
 be said that every punishment that we suffer proceeds from our own sin, or
 at least from the original sin in which we were born, which is itself the
 cause of all causes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But as to the punishment of loss, meaning by that eternal damnation which
 they will suffer in the future, no one doubts that all the damned will be
 tortured with grevious pains. For just as grace is followed by the blessed
 vision of the Kingdom of Heaven, so is mortal sin followed by punishment in
 hell. And just as the degrees of blessedness in Heaven are measured in
 accordance with the degrees of charity and grace in life, so the degrees of
 punishment in hell are measured according to the degree of crime in this
 life. See <i>Deuteronomy</i> xxv: The measure of punishment will be according
 to the measure of sin. And this is so with all other sins, but applies
 especially to witches. See <i>Hebrews</i> x: Of how much sorer punishment,
 suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden underfoot the Son
 of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
 sanctified, an unholy thing?<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And such are the sins of witches, who deny the Faith, and work many evil
 bewitchments through the most Holy Sacrament, as will be shown in the
 Second Part.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 1</h1>
<h2>Question XVI</h2>
<h3>The Foregoing Truths are Set out in Particular, this by a Comparison of the Works of Witches with Other Baleful Superstitions.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the foregoing truth concerning the enormity of witches' crimes is proved
 by comparing them with the other practices of Magicians and Diviners. For
 there are fourteen species of magic, springing from the three kinds of
 Divination. The first of these three is open invocation of devils. The
 second is no more than a silent consideration of the disposition and
 movement of some thing, as of the stars, or the days, or the hours, and such
 things. The third is the consideration of some human act for the purpose of
 finding out something that is hidden, and is called by the name of
 Sortilege.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the species of the first form of Divination, that is, an open invocation
 of devils, are the following: Sorcery, Oneiromancy, Necromancy, Oracles,
 Geomancy, Hydromancy, Aeromancy, Pyromancy, and Soothsaying (see S. Thomas,
 <i>Second of the Second</i>, quest. 95, 26, and 5). The species of the
 second kind are Horoscopy, Haruspicy, Augury, Observation of Omens,
 Cheiromancy and Spatulamancy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The species of the third kind vary according to all those things which are
 classed as Sortilege for the finding out of something hidden, such as the
 consideration of pricks and straws, and figures in molten lead. And S. Thomas
 speaks also of these in the above-quoted reference.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the sins of witches exceed all these crimes, as will be proved in respect
 of the foregoing species. There can then be no question concerning smaller
 crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For let us consider the first species, in which those who are skilled in
 sorcery and glamour deceive the human senses with certain apparitions, so
 that corporeal matter seems to become different to the sight and the touch,
 as was treated of above in the matter of the methods of creating illusions.
 Witches are not content with such practices in respect of the genital
 member, causing some prestidigitatory illusion of its disappearance
 (although this disappearance is not an actual fact); but they even frequently
 take away the generative power itself, so that a woman cannot conceive, and
 a man cannot perform the act even when he still retains his member. And
 without any illusion, they also cause abortion after conception, often
 accompanied with many other ills. And they even appear in various forms of
 beasts, as has been shown above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Necromancy is the summoning of and speech with the dead, as is shown by its
 etymology; for it is derived from the Greek word <i>Nekros</i>, meaning a
 corpse, and <i>Manteia</i>, meaning divination. And they accomplish this by
 working some spell over the blood of a man or some animal, knowing that the
 devil delights in such sin, and loves blood and the pouring out of blood.
 Wherefore, when they think that they call the dead from hell to answer their
 questions, it is the devils in the likeness of the dead who appear and give
 such answers. And of this sort was the art of that great Pythoness spoken
 of in I. <i>Kings</i> xxviii, who raised up Samuel at the instance of Saul.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But let no one think that such practices are lawful because the Scripture
 records that the soul of the just Prophet, summoned from Hades to predict the
 event of Saul's coming war, appeared through the means of a woman who was a
 witch. For, as S. Augustine says to Simplicianus: It is not absurd to believe
 that it was permitted by some dispensation, nto by the potency of any magic
 art, but by some hidden dispensation unknown to the Pythoness or to Saul, that
 the spirit of that just man should appear before the sight of the king, to
 deliver the Divine sentence against him. Or else it was not really the spirit
 of Samuel aroused from its rest, but some phantasm and imaginary illusion of
 devils caused by the machinations of the devil; and the Scripture calls that
 phantasm by the name of Samuel, just as the images of things are called by the
 names of the things they represent. This he
 says in his answer to the question whether divination by the invocation of
 devils is lawful. In the same <i>Summa</i> the reader will find the answer to
 the question whether there are degrees of prophecy among the Blessed; and he
 may refer to S. Augustine, XXVI, 5. But this has little to do with the deeds
 of witches, which retain in themselves no vestige of piety, as is apparent
 from a consideration of their works; for they do not cease to shed innocent
 blood, to bring hidden things to light under the guidance of devils, and by
 destroying the soul with the body spare neither the living nor the dead.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Oneiromancy may be practised in two ways. The first is when a person uses
 dreams so that he may dip into the occult with the help of the revelation of
 devils invoked by him, with whom he has entered into an open pact. The second
 is when a man uses dreams for knowing the future, in so far as there is such
 virtue in dreams proceeding from Divine revelation, from a natural and
 instinsic or extrinsic cause; and such divination would not be unlawful. So
 says S. Thomas.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And that preachers may have at least the nucleus of an understanding of this
 matter, we must first speak about the Angels. An Angel is of limited power,
 and can more effectively reveal the future when the mind is adapted to such
 revelations than when it is not. Now the mind is chiefly so adapted after the
 relaxation of exterior and interior movement, as when nights are silent and
 the fumes of motion are quieted; and these conditions are fulfilled round
 about the dawn, when digestion is completed. And I say this of us who are
 sinners, to whom the Angels in their Divine piety, and in the execution of
 their offices, reveal certain things, so that when we study at the time of the
 dawn we are given an understanding of certain occult matters in the
 Scriptures. For a good Angel presides over our understanding, just as God does
 over our will, and the stars over our bodies. But to certain more perfect men
 the Angel can at any hour reveal things, whether they are awake or asleep.
 However, according to Aristotle, <i>de Somno et Uigilia</i>, such men are more
 apt to receive revelations at one time than at another; and this is the casein
 all matters of magic.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it is to be noted that is happens through Nature's care for and
 regulation of the body, that certain future events have their natural cause in
 a man's dreams. And then those dreams or visions are not cause, as was said in
 the case of Angels, but only signs of that which is coming to a man in the
 future, such as health or sickness or danger. And this is the opinion of
 Aristotle. For in the dreams of the spirit Nature images the disposition of
 the heart, by which sickness or some other thing naturally comes to a man in
 the future. For is a man dreams of fires, it is a sign of a choleric
 disposition; if of flying or some such thing, it is a sign of a sanguine
 disposition; if he dreams of water or some other liquid, it is a sign of a
 phlegmatic, and if he dreams of terrene matters, it is a sign of a melancholy
 disposition. And therefore doctors are very often helped by dreams in their
 diagnosis (as Aristotle says in the same book).<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But these are slight matters in comparison with the unholy dreams of witches.
 For when they do not wish, as has been mentioned above, to be bodily
 transferred to a place, but desire to see what their fellow-witches are doing,
 it is their practice to lie down on their left side in the name of their own
 and of all devils; and these things are revealed to their vision in images.
 And if they seek to know some secret, either for themselves of for others,
 they learn it in dreams from the devil, by reason of an open, not a tacit,
 pact entered into with him. And this pact, again, is not a symbolical one,
 accomplished by the sacrifice of some animal, or some act of sacrilege, or by
 embracing the worship of some strange cult; but it is an actual offering of
 themselves, body and soul, to the devil, by a sacrilegiously uttered and
 inwardly purposed abnegation of the Faith. And not content with this, they
 even kill, or offer to devils, their own and others' children.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Another species of divination is practised by Pythons, so called from Pythian
 Apollo, who is said to have been the originator of this kind of divination,
 according to S. Isidore. This is not effected by dreams or by converse with
 the dead, but by means of living men, as in the case of those who are lashed
 into a frenzy by the devil, either willingly or unwillingly, only for the
 purpose of foretelling the future, and not for the perpetration of any other
 monstrosities. Of this sort was the girl mentioned in <i>Acts</i> xvi, who
 cried after the Apostles that they were the servants of the true God; and S.
 Paul, being angered by this, commanded the spirit to come out of her. But it
 is clear that there is no comparison between such things and the deeds of
 witches, who, according to S. Isidore, are so called for the magnitude of
 their sins and the enormity of their crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore, for the sake of brevity, there is no need to continue this argument
 in respect of the minor forms of divination, since it has been proved in
 respect of the major forms. For the preacher may, if he wishes, apply these
 arguments to the other forms of divination: to Geomancy, which is concerned
 with terrene matters, such as iron or polished stone; Hydromancy, which deals
 with water and crystals; Aeromancy, which is concerned with the air;
 Pyromancy, which is concerned with fire; Soothsaying, which has to do with the
 entrails of animals sacrificed on the devil's altars. For although all these
 are done by means of open invocation of devils, they cannot be compared with
 the crimes of witches, since they are not directly purposed for the harming of
 men or animals or the fruits of the earth, but only for the foreknowledge of
 the future. The other species of divination, which are performed with a tacit,
 but not an open, invocation of devils, are Horoscopy, or Astrology, so called
 from the consideration of the stars at birth; Haruspicy, which observes the
 days and hours; Augury, which observes the behaviour and cries of birds;
 Omens, which observe the words of men; and Cheiromancy, which observes the
 lines of the hand, or of the paws of animals. Andone who wishes may refer to
 the teaching of Nider, and he will find mush as to when such things are lawful
 and when they are not. But the works of witches are never lawful.

<h2>Question XVII</h2>
<h3>A Comparison of their Crimes under Fourteen Heads, with the Sins of the Devils of all and every Kind.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 So heinous are the crimes of witches that they even exceed the sins and the
 fall of the bad Angels; and if this is true as to their guilt, how should it
 not also be true of their punishments in hell? And it is not difficult to
 prove this by various arguments with regard to their guilt. And first,
 although the sin of Satan is unpardonable, this is not on account of the
 greatness of his crime, having regard to the nature of the Angels, with
 particular attention to the opinion of those who say that the Angels were
 created only in a state of nature, and never in a state of grace. And since
 the good of grace exceeds the good of nature, therefore the sins of those who
 fall from a state of grace, as do the witches by denying the faith which they
 received in baptism, exceed the sins of the Angels. And even if we say that
 the Angels were created, but not confirmed, in grace; so also witches, though
 they are not created in grace, have yet of their own will fallen from grace;
 just as Satan sinned of his own will.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it is granted that Satan's sin is unpardonable for various other
 reasons. For S. Augustine saus that he sinned at the instigation of none,
 therefore his sin is justly remediable by none. And S. John Damascene says
 that he sinned in his understanding against the character of God; and that his
 sin was the greater by reason of the nobility of his understanding. For the
 servant who knows the will of his master, etc. The same authority says that,
 since Satan is incapable of repentance, therefore he is incapable of pardon;
 and this is due to his very nature, which, being spiritual, could only be
 changed once, when he changed it for ever; but this is not so with men, in
 whom the flesh is always warring against the spirit. Or because he sinned in
 the high places of heaven, whereas man sins in the earth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But notwithstanding all this, his sin is in many respects small in comparison
 with the crimes of witches. First, as S. Anselm showed
 in one of his <i>Sermons</i>, he sinned in his pride while there was yet no
 punishment for sin. But witches continue to sin after great punishments have
 been often inflicted upon many other witches, and after the punishments which
 the Church teaches them have been inflicted by reason of the devil and his
 fall; and they make light of all these, and hasten to commit, not the least
 deadly of sins, as do other sinners who sin through infirmity or wickedness
 yet not from habitual malice, but rather the most horrible crimes from the
 deep malice of their hearts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, although the Bad Angel fell from innocence to guilt, and thence to
 misery and punishment; yet he fell from innocence once only, in such a way
 that he was never restored. But the sinner who is restored to innocence by
 baptism, and again falls from it, falls very deep. And this is especially true
 of witches, as is proved by their crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, he sinned against the Creator; but we, and especially witches, sin
 against the Creator and the Redeemer.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fourthly, he forsook God, who permitted him to sin but accorded him no pity;
 whereas we, and witches above all, withdraw ourselves from God by our sins,
 while, in spite of his permission of our sins, He continually pities us and
 prevents us with His countless benefits.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fifthly, when he sinned, God rejected him without showing him and grace;
 whereas we wretches run into sin although God is continually calling us
 back.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Sixthly, he keeps his heart hardened against a punisher; but we against a
 merciful persuader. Both sin against God; but he against a commanding God, and
 we against One who dies for us, Whom, as we have said, wicked witches offend
 above all. <br/><br/>
<div style="text-align: center;"><i>The Solutions of the Arguments again Declare the Truth by Comparison.</i></div>
<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To the arguments. The answer to the first is clear from what was said in the
 beginning of this whole question. It was submitted that one sin ought to be
 thought heavier than another; and that the sins of witches are heavier than
 all others in respect of guilt, but not in respect of the penalties that they
 entail. To this it must be said that the punishment of Adam, just as his
 guilt, may be considered two ways; either as touching him personally, or as
 touching the whole of nature, that is, the posterity whcih came after him. As
 to the first, greater sins have been committed after Adam; for he sinned only
 in doing that which was evil, not in itself, but because it was forbidden.
 Therefore such sins deserve the heavier punishment.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As to the second, it is true that the greatest punishment resulted from the
 first sin; but this is only indirectly true, in that through Adam all
 posterity was infected with original sin, and he was the first father of all
 those for whom the Only Son of God was able to atone by the power which was
 ordained. Moreover, Adam in his own person, with the mediation of Divine
 grace, repented, and was afterwards saved through the Sacrifice of Christ. But
 the sins of witches are incomparably greater, since they are not content with
 their own sins and perdition, but ever draw countless others after them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And thirdly, it follows from what has been said that it was by accident that
 Adam's sin involved the greater injury. For he found nature uncorrupted, and
 it was inevitable, and not of his own will, that he left it defiled; therefore
 it does not follow that his sin was intrinsically greater than others. And
 again, posterity would have committed the same sin if it had found nature in
 the same state. Similarly, he who has not found grace does not commit so
 deadly a sin as he who has found it and lost it. This is the solution of S.
 Thomas (II, 21, art. 2), in his solution of the second argument. And if anyone
 wishes fully to understand this solution, he must consider that even if Adam
 had kept his original innocence, he would not have passed it down to all
 posterity; for, as S. Anselm says, anyone coming after him could still have
 sinned. See also S. Thomas, dist. 20, where he considers whether new-born
 children would have been confirmed in grace; and in dist. 101, whether men who
 are now saved would have been saved if Adam had not sinned.

<h2>Question XVIII</h2>
<h3>Here follows the Method of Preaching against and Controverting Five Arguments of Laymen and Lewd Folk, which seem to be Variously Approved, that God does not Allow so Great Power to the Devil and Witches as is involved in the Performance of such Mighty Works of Witchcraft.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Finally, let the preacher br armed against certain arguments of laymen, and
 even of some learned men, who deny, up to a certain point, that there are
 witches. For, although they conceded the malice and power of the devil to
 inflict such evils at his will, they deny that the Divine permission is
 granted to him, and will not admit that God allows such things to be done.
 And although they have no method in their argument, groping blindly now this
 way and now that, it is yet necessary to reduce their assertions to five
 arguments, from which all their cavillings proceed. And the first is, that
 God does not permit the devil to rage against men wish such great power.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The question put is whether the Divine permission must always accompany an
 infliction caused by the devil through a witch. And give arguments are
 submitted to prove that God does not permit it, and that therefore there is
 no witchcraft in the world. And the first argument is taken from God; the
 second from the devil; the third from the witch; the fourth from the
 affliction ascribed to witchcraft; and the fifth from the preachers and
 judges, on the assumption that they have so preached against and punished
 witches that they would have no security in life.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And first as follows: God can punish men for their sins, and He punishes
 with the sword, famine, and pestilence; as well as with various and countless
 other infirmities to which human nature is subject. Wherefore, there being
 no need for Him to add further punishments, He does not permit witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, if that which is said of the devil were true, namely, that he can
 obstruct the generative forces so that a woman cannot conceive, or that if
 she does conceive, he can cause an abortion; or, if there is no abortion, he
 can cause the children to be killed after birth; in that case he would be
 able to destroy the whole world; and it could also be said that the devil's
 works were stronger than God's, since the Sacrament of matrimony is a work
 of God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, they argue from man himself, that if there were any witchcraft in
 the world, then some men would be more bewitched than others; and that it is
 a false argument to say that men are bewitched for a punishment of their
 sins, and therefore false to maintain that there is witchcraft in the world.
 And they prove that it is false by arguing that, if it were true, then the
 greater sinners would receive the greater punishment, and that this is not
 the case; for sinners are less punished sometimes than the just, as is seen
 in the case of innocent children who are alleged to be bewitched.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Their fourth argument can be added to that which they adduce concerning God;
 namely, that a thing which a man can prevent and does not prevent, but
 allows it to be done, may be judged to proceed from his will. But since God
 is All-Good, He cannot wish evil, and therefore cannot permit evil to be
 done which He is able to prevent.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, taking their argument from the infliction itself, which is alleged to
 be due to witchcraft; they submit that they are similar to natural
 infirmities and defects, and may therefore by cause by a natural defect. For
 it may happen through some natural defect that a man becomes lame, or blind,
 or loses his reason, or even dies; wherefore such things cannot confidently
 be ascribed to witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Lastly, they argue that preachers and judges have preached and practised
 against witches in such a way that, if there were witches, their lives would
 never be safe from them on account of the great hatred that witches would
 have for them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the contrary arguments may be taken from the First Question, where it
 treats of the third postulate of the First Part; and those points may be
 propounded to the people which are most fitting. How God permits evil to be,
 even though He does not wish it; but He permits it for the wonderful
 perfecting of the universe, which may be considered in the fact that good
 things are more highly commendable, are more pleasing and laudable, when
 they are compared with bad things; and authority can be quoted in support of
 this. Also that the depth of God's Divine wisdom, justice, and goodness
 should be shown forth, whereas it would otherwise remain hidden.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For a brief settlement of this question there are various treatises available
 on this subject for the information of the people, to the effect, namely,
 that God justly permitted two Falls, that of the Angels and that of our
 first parents; and since these were the greatest of all falls, it is no
 matter for wonder if other smaller ones are permitted. But it is in their
 consequences that those two Falls were the greatest, not in their
 circumstances, in which last respect, as was shown in the last Question, the
 sins of witches exceed those of the bad angels and our first parents. In the
 same place it is shown how God justly permitted those first Falls, and
 anyone is at liberty to collect and enlarge upon what is there said as much
 as he wishes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But we must answer their arguments. As to the first, that God punishes quite
 enough by means of natural diseases, and by sword and famine, we make a
 threefold answer. First, that God did not limit His power to the processes
 of nature, or even to the influences of the stars, in such a way that He
 cannot go beyond those limits; for He has often exceeded them in the
 punishment of sins, by sending plagues and other afflictions beyond all the
 influence of that stars; as when He punished the sin of pride in David, when
 he numbered the people, by sending a pestilence upon the people.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it agrees with the Divine wisdom that He should so govern all
 things that He allows them to act at their own instigation. Consequently, it
 is not His purpose to prevent altogether the malice of the devil, but rather
 to permit it as far as He sees it to be for the ultimate good of the
 universe; although it is true that the devil is continually held in check by
 the good Angels, so that he may not do all the harm that he wishes.
 Similarly He does not propose to restrain the human sins which are possible
 to man through his free-will, such as the abnegation of the Faith, and the
 devotion of himself to the devil, which things are in the power of the human
 will. From these two premisses it follows that, when God is most offended,
 He justly permits those evils which are chiefly sought for by witches, and
 for which they deny the Faith, up to the extent of the devil's power; and
 such is the ability to injure men, animals, and the fruits of the earth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, God justly permits those evils which indirectly cause the greatest
 uneasiness and torment to the devil; and of such a sort are those evils
 which are done by witches through the power of devils. For the devil is
 indirectly tormented very greatly when he sees that, against his will, God
 uses all evil for the glory of His name, for the commendation of the Faith,
 for the purgation of the elect, and for the acquisition of merit. For it is
 certain that nothing can be more galling to the pride of the devil, which he
 always rears up against God (as it is said: The pride of them that hate Thee
 increases ever), than that God should convert his evil machinations to His
 own glory. Therefore God justly permits all these things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Their second argument has been answered before; but there are two points in
 it which must be answered in detail. In the first place, far from its being
 true that the devil, or his works, as stronger than God, it is apparent that
 his power is small, since he can do nothing without the Divine permission.
 Therefore it may be said that the devil's power is small in comparison with
 the Divine permission, although it is very great in comparison with earthly
 powers, which it naturally excels, as is shown in the often quoted text in
 <i>Job</i> xi: There is no power on earth to be compared with him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the second place, we must answer the question with God permits witchcraft
 to affect the generative powers more than any other human function. This has
 been dealt with above, under the title, How witches can obstruct the
 generative powers and the venereal act. For it is on account of the
 shamefulness of that act, and because the original sin due to the guilt of
 our first parents is inherited by means of that act. It is symbolized also
 by the serpent, who was the first instrument of the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To their third we answer that the devil has more intention and desire to
 tempt the good than the wicked; although he does in fact tempt the wicked
 more than the good, for the reason that the wicked have more aptitude than
 the good to respond to his temptation. In the same way, he is more eager to
 injure the good than the bad, but he finds it easier to injure the wicked.
 And the reason for this is, according to S. Gregory, that the more often a
 man gives way to the devil, the harder he makes it for himself to struggle
 against him. But since it is the wicked who most often give way to the devil,
 their temptations are the hardest and most frequent, as they have not the
 shield of Faith with which to protect themselves. Concerning this shield S.
 Paul speaks in <i>Ephesians</i> vi. Above all, taking the shield of faith,
 wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. But
 on the other hand, he assails the good more bitterly than the wicked. And
 the reason for this is that he already possesses the wicked, but not the
 good; and therefore he tried the harder to draw into his power through
 tribulation the just, who are not his, than the wicked, who are already his.
 In the same way, an earthly prince more severely chastises those who disobey
 his laws, or injure his kingdom, that those who do not set themselves against
 him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In answer to their fourth argument, in addition to what has already been
 written on this subject, the preacher can expound the truth that God permits
 evil to be done, but does not wish it to be done, by the five signs of the
 Divine will, which are Precept, Prohibition, Advice, Operation, and
 Permission. See S. Thomas, especially in his First Part, quest. 19, art. 12,
 where this is very plainly set forth. For although there is only one will in
 God, which is God Himself, just as His Essence is One; yet in respect of its
 fulfilment, His will is shown and signified to us in many ways, as the
 <i>Psalm</i> says: The mighty works of the Lord are fulfilled in all His
 wishes. Wherefore there is a distinction between the actual essential Will
 of God and its visible effects; even as the will, properly so called, is the
 will of a man's good pleasure, but in a metaphorical sense it is the will
 expressed by outward signs. For it is by signs and metaphors that we are
 shown that God wishes this to be.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We may take an example from a human father who, while he has only one will
 in himself, expresses that will in five ways, either by his own agency, or
 through that of someone else. Through his own agency he expresses it in two
 ways, either directly or indirectly. Directly, when he himself does a thing;
 and then it is Operation. Indirectly, when he does not hinder someone else
 from acting (see Aritotle's <i>Physics</i>, IV: Prohibition is indirect
 causation), and this is called the sign of Permission. And the human father
 signifies his will through the agency of someone else in three ways. Either
 he orders someone to do something, or conversely forbids something; and
 these are the signs of Precept and Prohibition. Or he persuades and advises
 someone to do something; and this is the sign of Advice. And just as the
 human will is manifested in these five ways, so is God's will. For that
 God's will is shown by Precept, Prohibition, and Advice is seen in
 <i>S. Matthew</i> vi: Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven: that is
 to say, may we on earth fulfil His Precepts, avoid His Prohibitions, and
 follow His Advice. And in the same way, S. Augustine shows that Permission
 and Operation are signs of God's will, where he says in the <i>Enchiridion:</i>
 Nothing is done unless Almighty God wishes it to be done, either by
 permitting it or by Himself doing it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To return to the argument; it is perfectly true that when a man can prevent
 a thing, and does not, that thing may be said to proceed from his will. And
 the inference that God, being All-Good, cannot wish evil to be done, is also
 true in respect of the actual Good Pleasure of God's Will, and also in
 respect of four of the signs of His Will; for it is needless to say that He
 cannot operate evil, or command evil to be done, or fail to be opposed to
 evil, or advise evil; but He can, however, permit evil to be done.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if it is asked how it is possible to distinguish whether an illness is
 caused by witchcraft or by some natural physical defect, we answer that
 there are various methods. And the first is by means of the judgement of
 doctors. See the words of S. Augustine <i>On the Christian Doctrine:</i> To
 this class of superstition belong all charms and amulets suspended or bound
 about the person, which the School of Medicine despises. For example,
 doctors may perceive from the circumstances, such as the patient's age,
 healthy complexion, and the reaction of his eyes, that his disease does not
 result from any defect of the blood or the stomach, or any other infirmity;
 and they therefore judge that it is not due to any natural defect, but to
 some extrinsic cause. And since that extrinsic cause cannot be any
 poisonous infection, which would be accompanied by ill humours in the blood
 and stomach, they have sufficient reason to judge that it is due to
 witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And secondly, when the disease is incurable, so that the patient can be
 relieved by no drugs, but rather seems to be aggravated by them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, the evil may come so suddenly upon a man that it can only be
 ascribed to witchcraft. An example of how this happened to one man has been
 made known to us. A certain well-born citizen of Spires had a wife who was
 of such an obstinate disposition that, though he tried to please her in
 every way, yet she refused in nearly every way to comply with his wishes,
 and was always plaguing him with abusive taunts. It happened that, on going
 into his house one day, and his wife railing against him as usual with
 opprobrious words, he wished to go out of the house to escape from
 quarrelling. But she quickly ran before him and locked the door by which he
 wished to go out; and loudly swore that, unless he beat her, there was no
 honesty or faithfulness in him. At these heavy words he stretched out his
 hand, not intending to hurt her, and struck her lightly with his open palm
 on the buttock; whereupon he suddenly fell to the ground and lost all his
 senses, and lay in bed for many weeks afflicted with a most grievous illness.
 Now it is obvious that this was not a natural illness, but was caused by
 some witchcraft of the woman. And very many similar cases have happened,
 and been made known to many.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There are some who can distinguish such illnesses by means of a certain
 practice, which is as follows. They hold molten lead over the sick man, and
 pour it into a bowl of water. And if the lead condenses into some image,
 they judge that the sickness is due to witchcraft. And when such men are
 asked whether the image so formed is caused by the work of devils, or is due
 to some natural cause, they answer that it is due to the power of Saturn
 over lead, the influence of that planet being in other respects evil, and
 that the sun has a similar power over gold. But what should be thought of
 this practice, and whether it is lawful or not, will be discussed in the
 Second Part of this treatise. For the Canonists say that it is lawful that
 vanity may be confounded by vanity; but the Theologians hold a directly
 opposite view, saying that it is not right to do evil that good may come.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In their last argument they advance several objections. First, why do not
 witches become rich? Secondly, why, having the favour of princes, do they
 not co-operate for the destruction of all their enemies? Thirdly, why are
 they unable to injure Preachers and others who persecute them?<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the first, it is to be said that witches are not generally rich for this
 reason: that the devils like to show their contempt for the Creator by
 buying witches for the lowest possible price. And also, lest they should be
 conspicuous by their riches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, they do not injure princes because they wish to retain, as far as
 possible, their friendship. And if it is asked why they do not hurt their
 enemies, it is answered that a good Angel, working on the other side,
 prevents such witchcraft. Compare the passage in
 <i>Daniel:</i> The Prince of the Persians
 withstood me for twenty-one days. See S. Thomas in the <i>Second Book of
 Sentences</i>, where he debates whether there is any contest among the good
 Angels, and of what sort.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, it is said that they cannot injure Inquisitors and other officials,
 because they dispense public justice. Many examples could be adduced to
 prove this, but time does not permit it.

<h2>Question I</h2>
<h3>Of those against whom the Power of Witches availeth not at all.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second main part of this work deals with the method of procedure
 adopted by witches for the performance of their witchcraft; and these are
 distinguished under eighteen heads, proceeding from two chief difficulties.
 The first of these two, dealt with in the beginning, concerns protective
 remedies, by which a man is rendered immune from witchcraft: the second,
 dealt with at the end, concerns curative remedies, by which those who
 are bewitched can be cured. For, as Aristotle says (<i>Physics</i>, IV),
 prevention and cure are related to one another, and are, accidentally,
 matters of causation. In this way the whole foundation of this horrible
 heresy may be made clear.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the above two divisions, the following points will be principally
 emphasized. First, the initiation of witches, and their profession of
 sacrilege. Second, the progress of their method of working, and of their
 horrible observances. Third, the preventive protections against their
 witchcrafts. And because we are now dealing with matters relating to morals
 and behaviour, and there is no need for a variety of arguments and
 disquisitions, since those matters which now follow under their headings
 are sufficiently discussed in the foregoing Questions; therefore we pray
 God that the reader will not look for proofs in every case, since it is
 enough to adduce examples that have been personally seen or heard, or are
 accepted at the word of credible witnesses.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the first of the points mentioned, two matters will be chiefly examined:
 first, the various methods of enticement adopted by the devil himself;
 second, the various ways in which witches profess their heresy. And in the
 second of the main points, six matters will be examined in order, relating
 to the procedure of witchcraft, and its cure. First, the practices of witches
 with regard to themselves and their own bodies. Second, their practices with
 regard to other men. Third, those relating to beasts. Fourth, the mischief
 they do to the fruits of the earth. Fifth, those kinds of witchcraft which
 are practised by men only and not by women. Sixth, the question of removing
 witchcraft, and how those who are bewitched may be cured. The First Question,
 therefore, is divided into eighteen heads, since in so many ways are their
 observances varied and multiplied.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is asked whether a man can be so blessed by the good Angels that he
 cannot be bewitched by witches in any of the ways that follow. And it seems
 that he cannot, for it has already been proved that even the blameless and
 innocent and the just are often afflicted by devils, as was Job; and many
 innocent children, as well as countless other just men, are seen to be
 bewitched, although not to the same extent as sinners; for they are not
 afflicted in the perdition of their souls, but only in their worldly goods
 and their bodies. But the contrary is indicated by the confessions of
 witches, namely, that they cannot injure everybody, but only those whom they
 learn, through the information of devils, to be destitute of Divine help.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. There are three classes of men blessed by God, whom that
 detestable race cannot injure with their witchcraft. And the first are those
 who administer public justice against them, or prosecute them in any public
 official capacity. The second are those who, according to the traditional
 and holy rites of the Church, make lawful use of the power and virtue which
 the Church by her exorcisms furnishes in the aspersion of Holy Water, the
 taking of consecrated salt, the carrying of blessed candles on the Day of
 the Purification of Our Lady, of palm leaves upon Palm Sunday, and men who
 thus fortify themselves are acting so that the powers of devils are
 diminished; and of these we shall speak later. The third class are those who,
 in various and infinite ways, are blessed by the Holy Angels.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The reason for this in the first class will be given and proved by various
 examples. For since, as S. Paul says, all power if from God, and a sword
 for the avenging of the wicked and the retribution of the good, it is no
 wonder that devils are kept at bay when justice is being done to avenge
 that horrible crime.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To the same effect the Doctors note that there are five ways in which the
 devil's power is hindered, either wholly or in part. First, by a limit fixed
 by God to his power, as is seen in <i>Job</i> i and ii. Another example is
 the case of the man we read of in the <i>Formicarius</i> of Nider, who had
 confessed to a judge that he had invoked the devil in order that he might
 kill an enemy of his, or do him bodily harm, or strike him dead with
 lightning. And he said: “When I had invoked the devil that I might
 commit such a deed with his help, he answered me that he was unable to do
 any of those things, because the man had good faith and diligently defended
 himself with the sign of the cross; and that therefore he could not harm him
 in his body, but the most he could do was to destroy an eleventh part of the
 fruit of his lands.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it is hindered by the application of some exterior force, as in
 the case of Balaam's ass, <i>Numbers</i> xxii. Thirdly, by some externally
 performed miracle of power. And there are some who are blessed with an
 unique privilege, as will be shown later in the case of the third class of
 men who cannot be bewitched. Fourthly, by the good providence of God, Who
 disposes each thing severally, and causes a good Angel to stand in the
 devil's way, as when Asmodeus killed the seven husbands of the virgin Sara,
 but did not kill Tobias.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fifthly, it is sometimes due to the caution of the devil himself, for at
 times he does not wish to do hurt, in order that worse may follow from it.
 As, for example, when he could molest the excommunicated but does not do
 so, as in the case of the excommunicated Corinthian (I. <i>Corinthians</i>
 v), in order that he may weaken the faith of the Church in the power of such
 banishment. Therefore we may similarly say that, even if the administrators
 of public justice were not protected by Divine power, yet the devils often
 of their own accord withdraw their support and guardianship from witches,
 either because they fear their conversion, or because they desire and hasten
 their damnation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This fact is proved also by actual experience. For the aforesaid Doctor
 affirms that witches have borne witness that it is a fact of their own
 experience that, merely because they have been taken by officials of public
 justice, they have immediately lost all their power of witchcraft. For
 example, a judge named Peter, whom we have mentioned before, wished his
 officials to arrest a certain witch called
 Stadlin; but their hands were seized with
 so great a trembling, and such a nauseous stench came into their nostrils,
 that they gave up hope of daring to touch the witch. And the judge commanded
 them, saying: “You may safely arrest the wretch, for when he is
 touched by the hand of public justice, he will lose all the power of his
 iniquity.” And so the event proved; for he was taken and burned for
 many witchcrafts perpetrated by him, which are mentioned here and there in
 this work in their appropriate places.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And many more such experiences have happened to us Inquisitors in the
 exercise of our inquisitorial office, which would turn the mind of the
 reader to wonder if it were expedient to relate them. But since self-praise
 is sordid and mean, it is better to pass them over in silence than to incur
 the stigma of boastfulness and conceit. But we must except those which have
 become so well known that they cannot be concealed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Not long ago in the town of Ratisbon the magistrates had condemned a witch
 to be burned, and were asked why it was that we Inquisitors were not
 afflicted like other men with witchcraft. They answered that witches had
 often tried to injure them, but could not. And, being asked the reason for
 this, they answered that they did not know, unless it was because the devils
 had warned them against doing so. For, they said, it would be impossible to
 tell how many times they have pestered us by day and by night, now in the
 form of apes, not of dogs or goats, disturbing us with their cries and
 insults; fetching us from our beds at their blasphemous prayers, so that we
 have stood outside the window of their prison, which was so high that no one
 could reach it without the longest of ladders; and then they have seemed to
 stick the pins with which their head-cloth was fastened violently into their
 heads. But praise be to Almighty God, Who in His pity, and for no merit of
 our own, has preserved us as unworthy public servants of the justice of the
 Faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The reason in the case of the second class of men is self-evident. For the
 exorcisms of the Church are for this very purpose, and are entirely
 efficacious remedies for preserving oneself from the injuries of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if it is asked in what manner a man ought to use such protections, we
 must speak first of those that are used without the uttering of sacred words,
 and then of the actual sacred invocations. For in the first place it is
 lawful in any decent habitation of men or beasts to sprinkle Holy Water for
 the safety and securing of men and beasts, with the invocation of the Most
 Holy Trinity and a Paternoster. For it is said in the Office of Exorcism,
 that wherever it is sprinkled, all uncleanness is purified, all harm is
 repelled, and no pestilent spirit can abide there, etc. For the Lord saves
 both man and beast, according to the Prophet, each in his degree.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, just as the first must necessarily be sprinkled, so in the case of
 a Blessed Candle, although it is more appropriate to light it, the wax of it
 may with advantage be sprinkled about dwelling-houses. And thirdly, it is
 expedient to place or to burn consecrated herbs in those rooms where they
 can best be consumed in some convenient place.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now it happened in the city of Spires, in the same year that this book was
 begun, that a certain devout woman held conversation with a suspected witch,
 and, after the manner of women, they used abusive words to each other. But
 in the night she wished to put her little suckling child in its cradle, and
 remembered her encounter that day with the suspected witch. So, fearing some
 danger to the child, she placed consecrated herbs under it, sprinkled it
 with Holy Water, put a little Blessed Salt to its lips, signed it with the
 Sign of the Cross, and diligently secured the cradle. About the middle of
 the night she heard the child crying, and, as women do, wished to embrace
 the child, and life the cradle on to her bed. She lifted the candle, indeed,
 but could not embrace the child, because he was not there. The poor woman,
 in terror, and bitterly weeping for the loss of her child, lit a light, and
 found the child in a corner under a chair, crying but unhurt.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In this it may be seen what virtue there is in the exorcisms of the Church
 against the snares of the devil. It is manifest that Almighty God, in His
 mercy and wisdom which extend from end to end, watches over the deeds of
 those wicked men; and that he gently directs the witchcraft of devils, so
 that when they try to diminish and weaken the Faith, they on the contrary
 strengthen it and make it more firmly rooted in the hearts of many. For the
 faithful may derive much profit from these evils; when, by reason of devils'
 works, the faith is made strong, God's mercy is seen, and His power
 manifested, and men are led into His keeping and to the reverence of Christ's
 Passion, and are enlightened by the ceremonies of the Church.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There lived in a town of Wiesenthal a certain Mayor who was bewitched with
 the most terrible pains and bodily contortions; and he discovered, not by
 means of other witches, but from his own experience, how that witchcraft
 had been practised on him. For he said he was in the habit of fortifying
 himself every Sunday with Blessed Salt and Holy Water, but that he had
 neglected to do so on one occasion owing to the celebration of somebody's
 marriage; and on that same day he was bewitched.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In Ratisbon a man was being tempted by the devil in the form of a woman to
 copulate, and became greatly disturbed when the devil would not desist. But
 it came into the poor man's mind that he ought to defend himself by taking
 Blessed Salt, as he had heard in a sermon. So, he took some Blessed Salt on
 entering the bath-room; and the woman looked fiercely at him, and, cursing
 whatever devil had taught him to do this, suddenly disappeared. For the
 devil can, with God's permission, present himself either in the form of a
 witch, or by possessing the body of an actual witch.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There were also three companions walking along a road, and two of them were
 struck by lightning. The third was terrified, when he heard voices speaking
 in the air, “Let us strike him too.” But another voice answered,
 “We cannot, for to-day he has heard the words ‘The Word was
 made Flesh.’” And he understood that he had been saved because
 he had that day heard Mass, and, at the end of the Mass, the Gospel of S.
 John: In the beginning was the Word, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also sacred words bound to the body are marvellously protective, if seven
 conditions for their use are observed. But these will be mentioned in the
 last Question of this Second Part, where we speak of curative, as here we
 speak of preventive measures. And those sacred words help not only to
 protect, but also to cure those who are bewitched.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the surest protection for places, men, or animals are the words of the
 triumphal title of our Saviour, if they be written in four places in the
 form of a cross: IESUS † NAZARENUS † REX † IUDAEORUM †.
 There may also be added the name of MARY and of the Evangelists, or the
 words of S. John: The Word was made Flesh.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the third class of men which cannot be hurt by witches is the most
 remarkable; for they are protected by a special Angelic guardianship, both
 within and without. Within, by the inpouring of grace; without, by the
 virtue of the stars, that is, by the protection of the Powers which move
 the stars. And this class is divided into two sections of the Elect: for
 some are protected against all sorts of witchcrafts, so that they can be
 hurt in no way; and others are particularly rendered chaste by the good
 Angels with regard to the generative functions, just as evil spirits by
 their witchcrafts inflame the lusts of certain wicked men towards one woman,
 while they make them cold towards another.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And their interior and exterior protection, by grace and by the influence
 of the stars, is explained as follows. For though it is God Himself Who
 pours grace into our souls, and no other creature has so great power as to
 do this (as it is said: The Lord will give grace and glory); yet, when God
 wished to bestow some especial grace, He does so in a dispositive way
 through the agency of a good Angel, as S. Thomas teaches us in a certain
 place in the <i>Third Book of Sentences</i>.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter I</h2>
<h3>Of the several Methods by which Devils through Witches Entice and Allure the Innocent to the Increase of that Horrid Craft and Company.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There are three methods above all by which devils, through the agency of
 witches, subvert the innocent, and by which that perfidy is continually
 being increased. And the first is through weariness, through inflicting
 grievous losses in their temporal possessions. For, as S. Gregory says: The
 devil often tempts us to give way from very weariness. And it is to be
 understood that it is within the power of a man to resist such temptation;
 but that God permits it as a warning to us not to give way to sloth. And in
 this sense is <i>Judges</i> ii to be understood, where it says that God did
 not destroy those nations, that through them He might prove the people of
 Israel; and it speaks of the neighbouring nations of the Canaanites,
 Jebusites, and others. And in our time the Hussites and other Heretics are
 permitted, so that they cannot be destroyed. Devils, therefore, by means of
 witches, so afflict their innocent neighbours with temporal losses, that
 they are to beg the suffrages of witches, and at length to submit themselves
 to their counsels; as many experiences have taught us.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We know a stranger in the diocese of Augsburg, who before he was forty-four
 years old lost all his horses in succession through witchcraft. His wife,
 being afflicted with weariness by reason of this, consulted with witches,
 and after following their counsels, unwholesome as they were, all the horses
 which he bought after that (for he was a carrier) were preserved from
 witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And how many women have complained to us in our capacity of Inquisitors,
 that when their cows have been injured by being deprived of their milk, or
 in any other way, they have consulted with suspected witches, and even been
 given remedies by them, on condition that they would promise something to
 some spirit; and when they asked what they would have to promise, the
 witches answered that it was only a small thing, that they should agree to
 execute the instructions of that master with regard to certain observances
 during the Holy Offices of the Church, or to observe some silent reservations
 in their confessions to priests.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be noted that, as has already been hinted, this iniquity has
 small and scant beginnings, as that of the time of the elevation of the Body
 of Christ they spit on the ground, or shut their eyes, or mutter some vain
 words. We know a woman who yet lives, protected by the secular law, who,
 when the priest at the celebration of the Mass blesses the people, saying,
 <i>Dominus uobiscum</i>, always adds to herself these words in the vulgar
 tongue “Kehr mir die Zung im Arss umb.” Or they even say some
 such thing at confession after they have received absolution, or do not
 confess everything, especially mortal sins, and so by slow degrees are led
 to a total abnegation of the Faith, and to the abominable profession of
 sacrilege.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This, or something like it, is the method which witches use towards honest
 matrons who are little given to carnal vices but concerned for worldly
 profit. But towards young girls, more given to bodily lusts and pleasures,
 they observe a different method, working through their carnal desires and
 the pleasures of the flesh.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be noted that the devil is more eager and keen to tempt the
 good than the wicked, although in actual practice he tempts the wicked more
 than the good, because more aptitude for being tempted is found in the
 wicked than in the good. Therefore the devil tries all the harder to seduce
 all the more saintly virgins and girls; and there is reason in this, besides
 many examples of it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For since he already possesses the wicked, but not the good, he tries the
 harder to seduce into his power the good whom he does not, than the wicked
 whom he does, possess. Similarly any earthly prince takes up arms against
 those who do not acknowledge his rule rather than those who do not oppose
 him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And here is an example. Two witches were burned in Ratisbon, as we shall
 tell later where we treat of their methods of raising tempests. And one of
 them, who was a bath-woman, had confessed among other things the following:
 that she had suffered much injury from the devil for this reason. There was
 a certain devout virgin, the daughter of a very rich man whom there is no
 need to name, since the girl is now dead in the disposition of Divine mercy,
 and we would not that his thought should be perverted by evil; and the witch
 was ordered to seduce her by inviting her to her house on some Feast Day, in
 order that the devil himself, in the form of a young man, might speak with
 her. And although she had tried very often to accomplish this, yet whenever
 she had spoken to the young girl, she had protected herself with the sign of
 the Holy Cross. And no one can doubt that she did this at the instigation of
 a holy Angel, to repel the works of the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Another virgin living in the diocese of Strasburg confessed to one of us
 that she was alone on a certain Sunday in her father's house, when an old
 woman of that town came to visit here and, among other scurrilous words,
 made the following proposition; that, if she liked, she would take her to a
 place where there were some young men unknown to all the townsmen. And when,
 said the virgin, I consented, and followed her to her house, the old woman
 said, “See, we go upstairs to an upper room where the young men are;
 but take care not to make the sign of the Cross.” I gave her my
 promise not to do so, and as she was going up before me and I was going up
 the stairs, I secretly crossed myself. At the top of the stairs, when we
 were both standing outside the room, the hag turned angrily upon me with a
 horrible countenance, and looking at me said, “Curse you! Why did you
 cross yourself? Go away from here. Depart in the name of the devil.”
 And so I returned unharmed to my home.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It can be seen from this how craftily that old enemy labours in the
 seduction of souls. For it was in this way that the bath-woman whom we have
 mentioned, and who was burned, confessed that she had been seduced by some
 old women. A different method, however, was used in the case of her
 companion witch, who had met the devil in human form on the road while she
 herself was going to visit her lover for the purpose of fornication. And
 when the Incubus devil had seen her, and has asked her whether she
 recognized him, and she had said that she did not, he had answered" “I
 am the devil; and if you wish, I will always be ready at your pleasure, and
 will not fail you in any necessity.” And when she had consented, she
 continued for eighteen years, up to the end of her life, to practise
 diabolical filthiness with him, together with a total abnegation of the
 Faith as a necessary condition.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is also a third method of temptation through the way of sadness and
 poverty. For when girls have been corrupted, and have been scorned by their
 lovers after they have immodestly copulated with them in the hope and
 promise of marriage with them, and have found themselves disappointed in all
 their hopes and everywhere despised, they turn to the help and protection of
 devils; either for the sake of vengeance by bewitching those lovers or the
 wives they have married, or for the sake of giving themselves up to every
 sort of lechery. Alas! experience tells us that there is no number to such
 girls, and consequently the witches that spring from this class are
 innumerable. Let us give a few out of many examples.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is a place in the diocese of Brixen where a young man deposed the
 following facts concerning the bewitchment of his wife.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 “In the time of my youth I loved a girl who importuned me to marry her;
 but I refused her and married another girl from another country. But wishing
 for friendship's sake to please her, I invited her to the wedding. She came,
 and while the other honest women were wishing us luck and offering gifts,
 she raised her hand and, in the hearing of the other women who were standing
 round, said, You will have few days of health after to-day. My bride was
 frightened, since she did not know her (for, as I have said, I had married
 her from another country), and asked the bystanders who she was who had
 threatened her in that way; and they said that she was a loose and vagrom
 woman. None the less, it happened just as she had said. For after a few days
 my wife was so bewitched that she lost the use of all her limbs, and even
 now, after ten years, the effects of witchcraft can be seen on her body.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 If we were to collect all the similar instances which have occurred in one
 town of that diocese, it would take a whole book; but they are written and
 preserved at the house of the Bishop of Brixen, who still lives to testify
 to their truth, astounding and unheard-of though they are.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But we must not pass over in silence one unheard-of and astonishing instance.
 A certain high-born Count in the ward of Westerich, in the diocese of
 Strasburg, married a noble girl of equal birth; but after he had celebrated
 the wedding, he was for three years unable to know her carnally, on account,
 as the event proved, of a certain charm which prevented him. In great
 anxiety, and not knowing what to do, he called loudly on the Saints of God.
 It happened that he went to the State of Metz to negotiate some business;
 and while he was talking about the streets and squares of the city, attended
 by his servants and domiciles, he met a certain women who had formerly been
 his mistress. Seeing her, and not at all thinking of the spell that was on
 him, he spontaneously addressed her kindly for the sake of their old
 friendship, asking her how she did, and whether she was well. And she,
 seeing the Count's gentleness, in her turn asked very particularly after his
 health and affairs; and when he answered that he was well, and that
 everything prospered with him, she was astonished and was silent for a time.
 The Count, seeing her thus astonished, again spoke kindly to her, inviting
 her to converse with him. So she inquired after his wife, and received a
 similar reply, that she was in all respects well. Then she asked if he had
 any children; and the Count said he had three sons, one born in each year.
 At that she was more astonished, and was again silent for a while. And the
 Count asked her, Why, my dear, do you make such careful inquiries? I am sure
 that you congratulate my on my happiness. Then she answered, Certainly I
 congratulate you; but curse that old woman who said she would bewitch your
 body so that you could not have connexion with your wife! And in proof of
 this, there is a pot in the well in the middle of your yard containing
 certain objects evilly bewitched, and this was placed there in order that,
 as long as its contents were preserved intact, for so long you would be
 unable to cohabit. But see! it is all in vain, and I am glad, etc. On his
 return home the Count did not delay to have the well drained; and, finding
 the pot, burned its contents and all, whereupon he immediately recovered the
 virility which he had lost. Wherefore the Countess again invited all the
 nobility to a fresh wedding celebration, saying that she was now the Lady of
 that castle and estate, after having for so long remained a virgin. For the
 sake of the Count's reputation it is not expedient to name that castle and
 estate; but we have related this story in order that the truth of the matter
 may be known, to bring so great a crime into open detestation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this it is clear that witches use various methods to increase their
 numbers. For the above-mentioned woman, because she had been supplanted by
 the Count's wife, case that spell upon the Count with the help of another
 witches; and this is how one witchcraft brings innumerable others in its
 train.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter II</h2>
<h3>Of the Way whereby a Formal Pact with Evil is made.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The method by which they profess their sacrilege through an open pact of
 fidelity to devils varies according to the several practices to which
 different witches are addicted. And to understand this it first must be
 noted that there are, as was shown in the First Part of this treatise, three
 kinds of witches; namely, those who injure but cannot cure; those who cure
 but, through some strange pact with the devil, cannot injure; and those who
 both injure and cure. And among those who injure, one class in particular
 stands out, which can perform every sort of witchcraft and spell,
 comprehending all that all the others individually can do. Wherefore, if we
 describe the method of profession in their case, it will suffice also for
 all the other kinds. And this class is made up of those who, against every
 instinct of human or animal nature, are in the habit of eating and devouring
 the children of their own species.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this is the most powerful class of witches, who practise innumerable
 other harms also. For they raise hailstorms and hurtful tempests and
 lightnings; cause sterility in men and animals; offer to devils, or otherwise
 kill, the children whom they do not devour. But these are only the children
 who have not been re-born by baptism at the font, for they cannot devour
 those who have been baptized, nor any without God's permission. They can
 also, before the eyes of their parents, and when no one is in sight, throw
 into the water children walking by the water side; they make horses go mad
 under their riders; they can transport themselves from place to place
 through the air, either in body or in imagination; they can affect Judges
 and Magistrates so that they cannot hurt them; they can cause themselves and
 other to keep silence under torture; they can bring about a great trembling
 in the hands and horror in the minds of those who would arrest them; they
 can show to others occult things and certain future events, by the
 information of devils, though this may sometimes have a natural cause (see
 the question: <i>Whether devils can foretell the future</i>, in the
 <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>); they can see absent things as if they were
 present; they can turn the minds of men to inordinate love or hatred; they
 can at times strike whom they will with lightning, and even kill some men
 and animals; they can make of no effect the generative desires, and even the
 power of copulation, cause abortion, kill infants in the mother's womb by a
 mere exterior touch; they can at time bewitch men and animals with a mere
 look, without touching them, and cause death; they dedicate their own
 children to devils; and in short, as has been said, they can cause all the
 plagues which other witches can only cause in part, that is, when the Justice
 of God permits such things to be. All these things this most powerful of all
 classes of witches can do, but they cannot undo them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it is common to all of them to practise carnal copulation with devils;
 therefore, if we show the method used by this chief class in their
 profession of their sacrilege, anyone may easily understand the method of
 the other classes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There were such witches lately, thirty years ago, in the district of Savoy,
 towards the State of Berne, as Nider tells in his <i>Formicarius</i>. And
 there are now some in the country of Lombardy, in the domains of the Duke of
 Austria, where the Inquisitor of Como, as we told in the former Part, caused
 forty-one witches to be burned in one year; and he was fifty-five years old,
 and still continues to labour in the Inquisition.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the method of profession is twofold. One is a solemn ceremony, like a
 solemn vow. The other is private, and can be made to the devil at any hour
 alone. The first method is when witches meet together in the conclave on a
 set day, and the devil appears to them in the assumed body of a man, and
 urges them to keep faith with him, promising them worldly prosperity and
 length of life; and they recommend a novice to his acceptance. And the devil
 asks whether she will abjure the Faith, and forsake the holy Christian
 religion and the worship of the Anomalous Woman (for so they call the Most
 Blessed Virgin MARY), and never venerate the Sacraments; and if he finds the
 novice or disciple willing, then the devil stretches out his hand, and so
 does the novice, and she swears with upraised hand to keep that covenant.
 And when this is done, the devil at once adds that this is not enough; and
 when the disciple asks what more must be done, the devil demands the
 following oath of homage to himself: that she give herself to him, body and
 soul, for ever, and do her utmost to bring others of both sexes into his
 power. He adds, finally, that she is to make certain unguents from the bones
 and limbs of children, especially those who have been baptized; by all which
 means she will be able to fulfil all her wishes with his help.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We Inquisitors had credible experience of this method in the town of
 Breisach in the diocese of Basel, receiving full information from a young
 girl witch who had been converted, whose aunt also had been burned in the
 diocese of Strasburg. And she added that she had become a witch by the
 method in which her aunt had first tried to seduce her.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For one day her aunt ordered her to go upstairs with her, and at her command
 to go into a room where she found fifteen young men clothed in green
 garments after the manner of German knights. And her aunt said to her:
 Choose whom you wish from these young men, and he will take you for his wife.
 And when she said she did not wish or any of them, she was sorely beaten and
 at last consented, and was initiated according to the aforesaid ceremony.
 She said also that she was often transported by night with her aunt over
 vast distances, even from Strasburg to Cologne.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This is she who occasioned our inquiry in the First Part into the question
 whether witches are truly and bodily transported by devils from place to
 place: and this was on account of the words of the Canon (6, q. 5,
 <i>Episcopi</i>), which seem to imply that they are only so carried in
 imagination; whereas they are at times actually and bodily transported.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For when she was asked whether it was only in imagination and phantastically
 that they so rode, through an illusion of devils, she answered that they did
 so in both ways; according to the truth which we shall declare later of the
 manner in which they are transferred from place to place. She said also that
 the greatest injuries were inflicted by midwives, because they were under an
 obligation to kill or offer to devils as many children as possible; and that
 she had been severely beaten by her aunt because she had opened a secret pot
 and found the heads of a great many children. And much more she told us,
 having first, as was proper, taken an oath to speak the truth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And he account of the method of professing the devil's faith undoubtedly
 agrees with what has been written by that most eminent Doctor, John Nider,
 who even in our times has written very illuminatingly; and it may be
 especially remarked that he tells of the following which he had from an
 Inquisitor of the diocese of Edua, who held many inquisitions on witches in
 that diocese, and caused many to be burned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For he says that this Inquisitor told him that in the Duchy of Lausanne
 certain witches had cooked and eaten their own children, and that the
 following was the method in which they became initiated into such practices.
 The witches met together and, by their art, summoned a devil in the form of
 a man, to whom the novice was compelled to swear to deny the Christian
 religion, never to adore the Eucharist, and to tread the Cross underfoot
 whenever she could do so secretly.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here is another example from the same source. There was lately a general
 report, brought to the notice of Peter the Judge in Boltingen, that thirteen
 infants had been devoured in the State of Berne; and the public justice
 exacted full vengeance on the murderers. And when Peter asked one of the
 captive witches in what manner they ate children, she replied: “This
 is the manner of it. We set our snares chiefly for unbaptized children, and
 even for those that have been baptized, especially when they have not been
 protected by the sign of the Cross and prayers” (Reader, notice that,
 at the devil's command, they take the unbaptized chiefly, in order that they
 may not be baptized), “and with our spells we kill them in their
 cradles or even when they are sleeping by their parents' side, in such a way
 that they afterwards are thought to have been overlain or to have died some
 other natural death. Then we secretly take them from their graves, and cook
 them in a cauldron, until the whole flesh comes away from the bones to make
 a soup which may easily be drunk. Of the more solid matter we make an
 unguent which is of virtue to help us in our arts and pleasures and our
 transportations; and with the liquid we fill a flask or skin, whoever drinks
 from which, with the addition of a few other ceremonies, immediately
 acquires much knowledge and becomes a leader in our sect.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here is another very clear and distinct example. A young man and his wife,
 both witches, were imprisoned in Berne; and the man, shut up by himself
 apart from her in a separate tower, said: “If I could obtain pardon
 for my sins, I would willingly declare all that I know about witchcraft; for
 I see that I ought to die.” And when he was told by the learned clerks
 who were there that he could obtain complete pardon if he truly repented,
 he joyfully resigned himself to death, and laid bare the method by which he
 had first been infected with his heresy. “The following,” he
 said, “is the manner in which I was seduced. It is first necessary
 that, on a Sunday before the consecration of Holy Water, the novice should
 enter the church with the masters, and there in their presence deny Christ,
 his Faith, baptism, and the whole Church. And then he must pay homage to the
 Little Master, for so and not otherwise do they call the devil.” Here
 it is to be noted that this method agrees with those that have been
 recounted; for it is immaterial whether the devil is himself present or not,
 when homage is offered to him. For this he does in his cunning, perceiving
 the temperament of the novice, who might be frightened by his actual
 presence into retracting his vows, whereas he would be more easily
 persuaded to consent by those who are known to him. And therefore they call
 him the Little Master when he is absent, that through seeming disparagement
 of his Master the novice may feel less fear. “And then he drinks from
 the skin, which has been mentioned, and immediately feels within himself a
 knowledge of all our arts and an understanding of our rites and ceremonies.
 And in this manner was I seduced. But I believe my wife to be so obstinate
 that she would rather go straight to the fire than confess the smallest part
 of the truth; but, alas! we are both guilty.” And as the young man
 said, so it happened in every respect. For the young man confessed and was
 seen to die in the greatest contrition; but the wife, though convicted by
 witnesses, would not confess any of the truth, either under torture or in
 death itself; but when the fire had been prepared by the gaoler, cursed him
 in the most terrible words, and so was burned. And from these examples their
 method of initiation in solemn conclave is made clear.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The other private method is variously performed. For sometimes when men or
 women have been involved in some bodily or temporal affliction, the devil
 comes to them speaking to them in person, and at times speaking to them
 through the mouth of someone else; and he promises that, if they will agree
 to his counsels, he will do for them whatever they wish. But he starts from
 small things, as was said in the first chapter, and leads gradually to the
 bigger things. We could mention many examples which have come to our
 knowledge in the Inquisition, but, since this matter presents no difficulty,
 it can briefly be included with the previous matter.


 <div style="text-align: center;">
<i>A Few Points are to be Noticed in the Explanation of their Oath of
 Homage.</i>
</div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now there are certain points to be noted concerning the homage which the
 devil exacts, as, namely, for what reason and in what different ways he does
 this. It is obvious that his principal motive is to offer the greater
 offence to the Divine Majesty by usurping to himself a creature dedicated
 to God, and thus more certainly to ensure his disciple's future damnation,
 which is his chief object. Nevertheless, it is often found by us that he has
 received such homage for a fixed term of years at the time of the profession
 of perfidy; and sometimes he exacts the profession only, postponing the
 homage to a later day.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And let us declare that the profession consists in a total or partial
 abnegation of the Faith: total, as has been said before, when the Faith is
 entirely abjured; partial, when the original pact makes it incumbent on the
 witch to observe certain ceremonies in opposition to the decrees of the
 Church, such as fasting on Sundays, eating meat on Fridays, concealing
 certain crimes at confession, or some such profane thing. But let us declare
 that homage consists in the surrender of body and soul.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we can assign four reasons why the devil requires the practice of such
 things. For we showed in the First Part of this treatise, when we examined
 whether devils could turn the minds of men to love or hatred, that they
 cannot enter the inner thoughts of the heart, since this belongs to God
 alone. But the devil can arrive at a knowledge of men's thoughts by
 conjecture, as will be shown later. Therefore, if that cunning enemy sees
 that a novice will be hard to persuade, he approaches her gently, exacting
 only small things that he may gradually lead her to greater things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it must be believed that there is some diversity among those who
 deny the Faith, since some do so with their lips but not in their heart,
 and some both with their lips and in their heart. Therefore the devil,
 wishing to know whether their profession comes from the heart as well as
 from the lips, sets them a certain period, so that he may understand their
 minds from their works and behaviour.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, if after the lapse of a set time he find that she is less willing
 to perform certain practices, and is bound to him only by word but not in
 her heart, he presumes that the Divine Mercy has given her the guardianship
 of a good Angel, which he knows to be of great power. Then he casts her off,
 and tries to expose her to temporal afflictions, so that he gain some
 profit from her despair.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter III</h2>
<h3>How they are Transported from Place to Place.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And now we must consider their ceremonies and in what manner they proceed in
 their operations, first in respect of their actions towards themselves and
 in their own persons. And among their chief operations are being bodily
 transported from place to place, and to practise carnal connexion with
 Incubus devils, which we shall treat of separately, beginning with their
 bodily vectification. But here it must be noted that this transvection
 offers a difficulty, which has often been mentioned, arising from one single
 authority, where it is said: It cannot be admitted as true that certain
 wicked women, perverted by Satan and seduced by the illusions and
 phantasms of devils, do actually, as they believe and profess, ride in the
 night-time on certain beasts with Diana, a goddess of the Pagans, or with
 Herodias and an innumerable multitude of women, and in the untimely silence
 of night pass over immense tracts of land, and have to obey her in all
 things as their Mistress, etc. Wherefore the priest of God ought to preach
 to the people that this is altogether false, and that such phantasms are
 sent not by God, but by an evil Spirit to confuse the minds of the faithful.
 For Satan himself transforms himself into various shapes and forms; and by
 deluding in dreams the mind which he holds captive, leads it through devious
 ways, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there are those who, taking their example from S. Germain and a certain
 other man who kept watch over his daughter to determine this matter,
 sometimes preach that this is an altogether impossible thing; and that it is
 indiscreet to ascribe to witches and their operations such levitations, as
 well as the injuries which happen to men, animals, and the fruits of the
 earth; since just as they are the victims of phantasy in their transvections,
 so also are they deluded in the matter of the harm they wreak on living
 creatures.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But this opinion was refuted as heretical in the First Question; for it
 leaves out of account the Divine permission with regard to the devil's
 power, which extends to even greater things than this: and it is contrary
 to the meaning of Sacred Scripture, and has caused intolerable damage to
 Holy Church, since now for many years, thanks to this pestiferous doctrine,
 witches have remained unpunished, because the secular courts have lost their
 power to punish them. Therefore the diligent reader will consider what was
 there set down for the stamping out of that opinion, and will for the
 present note how they are transported, and in what ways this is possible, of
 which some examples will be adduced.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is shown in various ways that they can be bodily transported; and first,
 from the operations of other Magicians. For if they could not be transported,
 it would either be because God does not permit it, or because the devil
 cannot do this since it is contrary to nature. It cannot be for the first
 reason, for both greater and less things can be done by the permission of
 God; and greater things are often done both to children and men, even to
 just men confirmed in grace.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For when it is asked whether substitutions of children can be affected by
 the work of devils, and whether the devil can carry a man from place to
 place even against his will; to the first question the answer is, Yes. For
 William of Paris says in the last part of his <i>De Uniuerso:</i>
 Substitutions of children are, with God's permission, possible, so that the
 devil can affect a change of the child or even a transformation. For such
 children are always miserable and crying; and although four or five mothers
 could hardly support enough milk for them, they never grow fat, yet are
 heavy beyond the ordinary. But this should neither be affirmed nor denied to
 women, on account of the great fear which it may cause them, but they should
 be instructed to ask the opinion of learned men. For God permits this on
 account of the sins of the parents, in that sometimes men curse their
 pregnant wives, saying, May you be carrying a devil! or some such thing. In
 the same way impatient women often say something of the sort. And many
 examples have been given by other men, some of them pious men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For Vincent of Beauvais (<i>Spec. Hist.</i>, XXVI, 43) related a story told
 by S. Peter Damian of a five-year-old son of
 a nobleman, who was for the time living in a monastery; and one night he
 was carried out of the monastery into a locked mill, where he was found in
 the morning. And when he was questioned, he said that he had been carried by
 some men to a great feast and bidden to eat; and afterwards he was put into
 the mill through the roof.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And what of those Magicians whom we generally call Necromancers, who are
 often carried through the air by devils for long distances? And sometimes
 they even persuade others to go with them on a horse, which is not really a
 horse but a devil in that form, and, as they say, thus warn their companions
 not to make the sign of the Cross.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And though we are two who write this book, one of us has very often seen and
 known such men. For there is a man who was once a scholar, and is now
 believed to be a priest in the diocese of Freising, who used to say that at
 one time he had been bodily carried through the air by a devil, and taken to
 the most remote parts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There lives another priest in Oberdorf, a town near Landshut, who was at
 that time a friend of that one of us, who saw with his own eyes such a
 transportation, and tells how the man was borne on high with arms stretched
 out, shouting but not whimpering. And the cause, as he tells it, was as
 follows. A number of scholars had met together to drink beer, and they all
 agreed that the one who fetched the beer should not have to pay anything.
 And so one of them was going to fetch the beer, and on opening the door saw
 a thick cloud before the grunsel, and returning in terror told his
 companions why he would not go for the drink. Then that one of them who was
 carried away said angrily: “Even if the devil were there, I shall
 fetch the drink.” And, going out, he was carried through the air in
 the sight of all the others.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And indeed it must be confessed that such things can happen not only to
 those who are awake, but also to men who are asleep; namely, they can be
 bodily transported through the air while they are fast asleep.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This is clear in the case of certain men who walk in their sleep on the
 roofs of houses and over the highest buildings, and no one can oppose their
 progress either on high or below. And if they are called by their own names
 by the other bystanders, they immediately fall crashing to the ground.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Many think, and not without reason, that this is devils' work. For devils
 are of many different kinds, and some, who fell from the lower choir of
 Angels, are tortured as if for smaller sins with lighter punishments as well
 as the punishment of damnation which they must suffer eternally. And these
 cannot hurt anybody, at least not seriously, but for the most part carry out
 only practical jokes. And others are Incubi or Succubi, who punish men in
 the night, defiling them in the sin of lechery. It is not wonderful if they
 are given also to horse-play such as this.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The truth can be deduced from the words of Cassian, <i>Collationes</i> I,
 where he says that there is no doubt that there are as many different
 unclean spirits as there are different desires in men. For it is manifest
 that some of them, which the common people call Fauns, and we call Trolls,
 which abound in Norway, are such buffoons and jokers that they haunt certain
 places and roads and, without being able to do any hurt to those who pass
 by, are content with mocking and deluding them, and try to weary them rather
 than hurt them. And some of them only visit men with harmless nightmares. But
 others are so furious and truculent that they are not content to afflict
 with an atrocious dilation the bodies of those whom they inflate, but even
 come rushing from on high and hasten to strike them with the most savage
 blows. Our author means that they do not only possess men, but torture them
 horribly, as did those which are described in <i>S. Matthew</i> viii.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this we can conclude, first that it must not be said that witches
 cannot be locally transported because God does not permit it. For if He
 permits it in the case of the just and innocent, and of other Magicians,
 how should He not in the case of those who are totally dedicated to the
 devil? And we say with all reverence: Did not the devil take up Our Saviour,
 and carry Him up to a high place, as the Gospel testifies?<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Neither can the second argument of our opponents be conceded, that the devil
 cannot do this thing. For it has already been shown that he has so great
 natural power, exceeding all corporeal power, that there is no earthly
 power that can be compared with him; as it is said: “There is no
 power on earth that can be compared with him,” etc. Indeed the natural
 power or virtue which is in Lucifer is so great that there is none greater
 among the good Angels in Heaven. For just as he excelled all the Angels in
 his nature, and not his nature, but only his grace, was diminished by his
 Fall, so that nature still remains in him, although it is darkened and bound.
 Wherefore the gloss on that “There is no power on earth” says:
 Although he excels all things, yet he is subject to the merits of the
 Saints.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Two objections which someone may bring forward are not valid. First, that
 man's soul could resist him, and that the text seems to speak of one devil
 in particular, since it speaks in the singular, namely Lucifer. And because
 it was he who tempted Christ in the wilderness, and seduced the first man,
 he is now bound in chains. And the other Angels are not so powerful, since
 he excels them all. Therefore the other spirits cannot transport wicked men
 through the air from place to place.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 These arguments have no force. For, to consider the Angels first, even the
 least Angel is incomparably superior to all human power, as can be proved in
 many ways. First, a spiritual is stronger than a corporeal power, and so is
 the power of an Angel, or even of the soul, greater than that of the body.
 Secondly, as to the soul; every bodily shape owes its individuality to
 matter, and, in the case of human beings, to the fact that a soul informs
 it; but immaterial forms are absolute intelligences, and therefore have an
 absolute and more universal power. For this reason, the soul when joined to
 the body cannot in this way suddenly transfer its body locally or raise it
 up in the air; although it could easily do so, with God's permission, if it
 were separate from its body. Much more, then, is this possible to an
 entirely immaterial spirit, such as a good or bad Angel. For a good Angel
 transported Habacuc in a moment from Judaea
 to Chaldaea. And for this reason it is concluded that those who by night
 are carried in their sleep over high buildings are not carried by their own
 souls, nor by the influence of the stars, but by some mightier power, as was
 shown above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, it is the nature of the body to be moved, as to place, directly by
 a spiritual nature; and, as Aristotle says, <i>Physics</i>, VIII, local
 motion is the first of bodily motions; and he proves this by saying that
 local motion is not intrinsically in the power of any body as such, but is
 due to some exterior force.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore it is concluded, not so much from the holy Doctors as from the
 Philosophers, that the highest bodies, that is, the stars, are moved by
 spiritual essences, and by separate Intelligences which are good both by
 nature and in intention. For we see that the soul is the prime and chief
 cause of local motion in the body.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It must be said, therefore, that neither in its physical capacity nor in
 that of its soul can the human body resist being suddenly transported from
 place to place, with God's permission, by a spiritual essence good both in
 intention and by nature, when the good, who are confirmed in grace, are
 transported; or by an essence good by nature, but not good in intention,
 when the wicked are transported. Any who wish may refer to S. Thomas in
 three articles in Part I, question 90, and again in his question concerning
 Sin, and also in the <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>, dist. 7, on the power
 of devils over bodily effects.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the following is their method of being transported. They take the
 unguent which, as we have said, they make at
 the devil's instruction from the limbs of children, particularly of those
 whom they have killed before baptism, and anoint with it a chair or a
 broomstick; whereupon they are immediately carried up into the air, either
 by day or by night, and either visibly or, if they wish, invisibly; for the
 devil can conceal a body by the interposition of some other substance, as
 was shown in the First Part of the treatise where we spoke of the glamours
 and illusions caused by the devil. And although the devil for the most part
 performs this by means of this unguent, to the end that children should be
 deprived of the grace of baptism and of salvation, yet he often seems to
 affect the same transvection without its use. For at times he transports
 the witches on animals, which are not true animals but devils in that form;
 and sometimes even without any exterior help they are visibly carried solely
 by the operation of the devil's power.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here is an instance of a visible transportation in the day-time. In the town
 of Waldshut on the Rhine, in the diocese of Constance, there was a certain
 witch who was so detested by the townsfolk that she was not invited to the
 celebration of a wedding which, however, nearly all the other townsfolk were
 present. Being indignant because of this, and wishing to be revenged, she
 summoned a devil and, telling him the cause of her vexation, asked him to
 raise a hailstorm and drive all the wedding guests from their dancing; and
 the devil agreed, and raising her up, carried her through the air to a hill
 near the town, in the sight of some shepherds. And since, as she afterwards
 confessed, she had no water to pour into the trench (for this, as we shall
 show, is the method they use to raise hailstorms), she made a small trench
 and filled it with her urine instead of water, and stirred it with her
 finger, after their custom, with the devil standing by. Then the devil
 suddenly raised that liquid up and sent a violent storm of hailstones which
 fell only on the dancers and townsfolk. And when they had dispersed and were
 discussing among themselves the cause of that storm, the witch shortly
 afterwards entered the town; and this greatly aroused their suspicions. But
 when the shepherds had told what they had seen, their suspicions became
 almost a certainty. So she was arrested, and confessed that she had done
 this thing because she had not been invited to the wedding: and for this,
 and for many other witchcrafts which she had perpetrated, she was burned.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter IV</h2>
<h3>Here follows the Way whereby Witches copulate with those Devils known as Incubi.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As to the method in which witches copulate with Incubus devils, six points
 are to be noted. First, as to the devil and the body which he assumes, of
 what element it is formed. Second, as to the act, whether it is always
 accompanied with the injection of semen received from some other man. Third,
 as to the time and place, whether one time is more favourable than another
 for this practice. Fourth, whether the act is visible to the women, and
 whether only those who were begotten in this way are so visited by devils.
 Fifth, whether it applies only to those who were offered to the devil at
 birth by midwives. Sixth, whether the actual venereal pleasure is greater or
 less in this act. And we will speak first of the matter and quality of the
 body which the devil assumes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It must be said that he assumes an aerial body, and that it is in some
 respects terrestrial, in so far as it has an earthly property through
 condensation; and this is explained as follows. The air cannot of itself
 take definite shape, except the shape of some other body in which it is
 included. And in that case it is not bound by its own limits, but by those
 of something else; and one part of the air continues into the next part.
 Therefore he cannot simply assume an aerial body as such.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Know, moreover, that the air is in every way a most changeable and fluid
 matter: and a sign of this is the fact that when any have tried to cut or
 pierce with a sword the body assumed by a devil, they have not been able to;
 for the divided parts of the air at once join together again. From this it
 follows that air is in itself a very competent matter, but because it cannot
 take shape unless some other terrestrial matter is joined with it, therefore
 it is necessary that the air which forms the devil's assumed body should be
 in some way inspissated, and approach the property of the earth, while still
 retaining its true property as air. And devils and disembodied spirits can
 effect this condensation by means of gross vapours raised from the earth,
 and by collecting them together into shapes in which they abide, not as
 defilers of them, but only as their motive power which give to that body the
 formal appearance of life, in very much the same way as the soul informs the
 body to which it is joined. They are, moreover, in these assumed and shaped
 bodies like a sailor in a ship which the wind moves.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 So when it is asked of what sort is the body assumed by the devil, it is to
 be said that with regard to its material, it is one thing to speak of the
 beginning of its assumption, and another thing to speak of its end. For in
 the beginning it is just air; but in the end it is inspisated air, partaking
 of some of the properties of the earth. And all this the devils, with God's
 permission, can do of their own nature; for the spiritual nature is superior
 to the bodily. Therefore the bodily nature must obey the devils in respect
 of local motion, though not in respect of the assumption of natural shapes,
 either accidental or substantial, except in the case of some small creatures
 (and then only with the help of some other agent, as has been hinted before).
 But as to local motion, no shape is beyond their power; thus they can move
 them as they wish, in such circumstances as they will.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this there may arise an incidental question as to what should be thought
 when a good or bad Angel performs some of the functions of life by means of
 true natural bodies, and not in aerial bodies; as in the case of Balaam's
 ass, through which the Angel spoke, and when the devils take possession of
 bodies. It is to be said that those bodies are not called assumed, but
 occupied. See S. Thomas, II. 8, Whether Angels assume bodies. But let us
 keep strictly to our argument.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In what way is it to be understood that devils talk with witches, see them,
 hear them, eat with them, and copulate with them? And this is the second
 part of this first difficulty.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the first, it is to be said that three things are required for true
 conversation: namely, lungs to draw in the air; and this is not only for the
 sake of producing sound, but also to cool the heart; and even mutes have
 this necessary quality.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it is necessary that some percussion be made of a body in the air,
 as a greater or less sound is made when one beats wood in the airs, or rings
 a bell. For when a substance that is susceptible to sound is struck by a
 sound-producing instrument, it gives out a sound according to its size,
 which is received in the air and multiplied to the ears of the hearer, to
 whom, if he is far off, it seems to come through space.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, a voice is required; and it may be said that what is called Sound
 in inanimate bodies is called Voice in living bodies. And here the tongue
 strikes the respirations of air against an instrument or living natural
 organ provided by God. And this is not a bell, which is called a sound,
 whereas this is a voice. And this third requisite may clearly be exemplified
 by the second; and I have set this down that preachers may have a method of
 teaching the people.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And fourthly, it is necessary that he who forms the voice should mean to
 express by means of that voice some concept of the mind to someone else, and
 that he should himself understand what he is saying; and so manage his voice
 by successively striking his teeth with his tongue in his mouth, by opening
 and shutting his lips, and by sending the air struck in his mouth into the
 outer air, that in this way the sound is reproduced in order in the ears of
 the hearer, who then understands his meaning.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To return to the point. Devils have no lungs or tongue, though they can show
 the latter, as well as teeth and lips, artificially made according to the
 condition of their body; therefore they cannot truly and properly speak. But
 since they have understanding, and when they wish to express their meaning,
 then, by some disturbance of the air included in their assumed body, not of
 air breathed in and out as in the case of men, they produce, not voices, but
 sounds which have some likeness to voices, and send them articulately through
 the outside air to the ears of the hearer. And that the likeness of a voice
 can be made without respiration of air is clear from the case of other
 animals which do not breathe, but are said to made a sound, as do also
 certain other instruments, as Aristotle says in the <i>de Anima</i>. For
 certain fishes, when they are caught, suddenly utter a cry outside the water,
 and die.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 All this is applicable to what follows, so far as the point where we treat
 of the generative function, but not as regards good Angels. If anyone wishes
 to inquire further into the matter of devils speaking in possessed bodies,
 he may refer to S. Thomas in the <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>, dist. 8,
 art. 5. For in that case they use the bodily organs of the possessed body;
 since they occupy those bodies in respect of the limits of their corporeal
 quantity, but not in respect of the limits of their essence, either of the
 body or of the soul. Observe a distinction between substance and quantity,
 or accident. But this is impertinent.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For now we must say in what manner they see and hear. Now sight is of two
 kinds, spiritual and corporeal, and the former infinitely excels the latter;
 for it can penetrate, and is not hindered by distance, owing to the faculty
 of light of which it makes use. Therefore it must be said that in no way
 does an Angel, either good or bad, see with the eyes of its assumed body,
 nor does it use any bodily property as it does in speaking, when it uses the
 air and the vibration of the air to produce sound which becomes reproduced
 in the ears of the hearer. Wherefore their eyes are painted eyes. And they
 freely appear to men in these likenesses that they may manifest to them
 their natural properties and converse with them spiritually by these means.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For with this purpose the holy Angels have often appeared to the Fathers at
 the command of God and with His permission. And the bad angels manifest
 themselves to wicked men in order that men, recognizing their qualities, may
 associate themselves with them, here in sin, and elsewhere in punishment.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 S. Dionysius, at the end of his <i>Celestial Hierarchy</i>, says: In all
 parts of the human body the Angel teaches us to consider their properties:
 concluding that since corporeal vision is an operation of the living body
 through a bodily organ, which devils lack, therefore in their assumed bodies,
 just as they have the likeness of limbs, so that have the likeness of their
 functions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we can speak in the same way of their hearing, which is far finer than
 that of the body; for it can know the concept of the mind and the conversation
 of the soul more subtly than can a man by hearing the mental concept through
 the medium of spoken words. See S. Thomas, the <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>,
 dist. 8. For if the secret wishes of a man are read in his face, and
 physicians can tell the thoughts of the heart from the heart-beats and the
 state of the pulse, all the more can such things be known by devils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we may say as to eating, that in the complete act of eating there are
 four processes. Mastication in the mouth, swallowing into the stomach,
 digestion in the stomach, and fourthly, metabolism of the necessary nutriment
 and ejection of what is superflous. All Angels can perform the first two
 processes fo eating in their assumed bodies, but not the third and fourth;
 but instead of digesting and ejecting they have another power by which the
 food is suddenly dissolved in the surrounding matter. In Christ the process
 of eating was in all respects complete, since He had the nutritive and
 metabolistic powers; not, be it said, for the purpose of converting food
 into His own body, for those power were, like His body, glorified; so that
 the food was suddenly dissolved in His body, as when one throws water on
 to fire.

<i>How in Modern Time Witches perform the Carnal Act with Incubus Devils,<br/>
 and how they are Multiplied by this Means.</i>
</div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But no difficulty arises out of what has been said, with regard to our
 principal subject, which is the carnal act which Incubi in an assumed body
 perform with witches: unless perhaps anyone doubts whether modern witches
 practise such abominable coitus; and whether witches had their origin in
 this abomination.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In answering these two doubts we shall say, as to the former of them,
 something of the activities of the witches who lived in olden times, about
 1400 years before the Incarnation of Our Lord. It is, for example, unknown
 whether they were addicted to these filthy practises as modern witches have
 been since that time; for so far as we know history tells us nothing on this
 subject. But no one who reads the histories can doubt that there have always
 been witches, and that by their evil works much harm has been done to men,
 animals, and the fruits of the earth, and that Incubus and Succubus devils
 have always existed; for the traditions of the Canons and the holy Doctors
 have left and handed down to posterity many things concerning them through
 many hundreds of years. Yet there is this difference, that in times long
 past the Incubus devils used to infest women against their wills, as is
 often shown by Nider in his <i>Formicarius</i>, and by Thomas of Brabant in
 his book on the <i>Universal Good</i>, or on <i>Bees</i>.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the theory that modern witches are tainted with this sort of diabolic
 filthiness is not substantiated only in our opinion, since the expert
 testimony of the witches themselves has made all these things credible; and
 that they do not now, as in times past, subject themselves unwillingly, but
 willingly embrace this most foul and miserable servitude. For how many
 women have be left to be punished by secular law in various dioceses,
 especially in Constance and the town of Ratisbon, who have been for many
 years addicted to these abominations, some from their twentieth and some
 from their twelfth or thirteenth year, and always with a total or partial
 abnegation of the Faith? All the inhabitants of those places are witnesses
 of it. For without reckoning those who secretly repented, and those who
 returned to the Faith, no less than forty-eight have been burned in five
 years. And there was no question of credulity in accepting their stories
 because they turned to free repentance; for they all agreed in this, namely,
 that there were bound to indulge in these lewd practices in order that the
 ranks of their perfidy might be increased. But we shall treat of these
 individually in the Second Part of this work, where their particular deeds
 are described; omitting those which came under the notice of our colleague
 the Inquisitor of Como in the County of Burbia, who in the space of one
 year, which was the year of grace 1485, caused forty-one witches to be
 burned; who all publicly affirmed, as it is said, that they had practised
 these abominations with devils. Therefore this matter is fully substantiated
 by eye-witnesses, by hearsay, and the testimony of credible witnesses.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As for the second doubt, whether witches had their origin from these
 abominations, we may say with S. Augustine that it is true that all the
 superstitious arts had their origin in a pestilent association of men with
 devils. For he says so in his work <i>On the Christian Doctrine:</i> All
 this sort of practices, whether of trifling or of noxious superstition,
 arose from some pestilent association of men with devils, as though some
 pact of infidel and guileful friendship had been formed, and they are all
 utterly to be repudiated. Notice here that it is manifest that, as there
 are various kinds of superstition or magic arts, and various societies of
 those who practise them; and as among the fourteen kinds of that art the
 species of witches is the worst, since they have not a tacit but an overt
 and expressed pact with the devil, and more than this, have to acknowledge
 a form of devil-worship through abjuring the Faith; therefore it follows
 that witches hold the worst kind of association with devils, with especial
 reference to the behaviour of women, who always delight in vain things.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter V</h2>
<h3>Witches commonly perform their Spells through the Sacraments of the Church. And how they Impair the Powers of Generation, and how they may Cause other Ills to happen to God's Creatures of all kinds. But herein we except the Question of the Influence of the Stars.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But now there are several things to be noted concerning their methods of
 bringing injury upon other creatures of both sexes, and upon the fruits of
 the earth: first with regard to men, then with regard to beasts, and thirdly
 with regard to the fruits of the earth. And as to men, first, how they can
 cast an obstructive spell on the procreant forces, and even on the venereal
 act, so that a woman cannot conceive, or a man cannot perform the act.
 Secondly, how that act is obstructed sometimes with regard to one woman but
 not another. Thirdly, how they take away the virile member as though it were
 altogether torn away from the body. Fourthly, if it is possible to
 distinguish whether any of the above injuries have been caused by a devil
 on his own account, or if it has been through the agency of a witch. Fifthly,
 how witches change men and women into beasts by some prestige or glamour.
 Sixthly, how witch midwives in various ways kill that which has been
 conceived in the mother's womb; and when they do not do this, offer the
 children to devils. And lest these things should seem incredible, they have
 been proved in the First Part of this work by questions and answers to
 arguments; to which, if necessary, the doubtful reader may turn back for the
 purpose of investigating the truth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the present our object is only to adduce actual facts and examples which
 have been found by us, or have been written by others in detestation of so
 great a crime, to substantiate those former arguments in case they should be
 difficult for anyone to understand; and, by those things that are related
 in this Second Part, to bring back to the Faith and away from their error
 those who think there are no witches, and that no witchcraft can be done in
 the world.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And with regard to the first class of injuries with which they afflict the
 human race, it is to be noted that, apart from the methods by which they
 injure other creatures, they have six ways of injuring humanity. And one is,
 to induce an evil love in a man for a woman, or in a woman for a man. The
 second is to plant hatred or jealousy in anyone. The third is to bewitch
 them so that a man cannot perform the genital act with a woman, or conversely
 a woman with a man; or by various means to procure an abortion, as has been
 said before. The fourth is to cause some disease in any of the human organs.
 The fifth, to take away life. The sixth, to deprive them of reason.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In this connexion it should be said that, saving the influence of the stars,
 the devils can by their natural power in every way cause real defects and
 infirmities, and this by their natural spiritual power, which is superior to
 any bodily power. For no one infirmity is quite like another, and this is
 equally true of natural defects in which there is no physical infirmity.
 Therefore they proceed by different methods to cause each different infirmity
 or defect. And of those we shall give instances in the body of this work as
 the necessity arises.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But first, lest the reader's mind should be kept in any doubt as to why they
 have no power to alter the influence of the stars, we shall say that there
 is a threefold reason. First, the stars are above them even in the region of
 punishment, which is the region of the lower mists; and this by reason of
 the duty which is assigned to them. See the First Part, Question II, where
 we dealt with Incubus and Succubus devils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second reason is that the stars are governed by the good Angels. See
 many places concerning the Powers which move the stars, and especially S.
 Thomas, part I, quest. 90. And in this matter the Philosophers agree with
 the Theologians.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, it is on account of the general order and common good of the
 Universe. which would suffer general detriment if evil spirits were allowed
 to cause any alteration in the influence of the stars. Wherefore those
 changes which were miraculously caused in the Old or New Testament were done
 by God through the good Angels; as, for example, when the sun stood still
 for Joshua, or when it went backward for Hezekiah, or when it was
 supernaturally darkened at the Passion of Christ. But in all other matters,
 with God's permission, they can work their spells, either the devils
 themselves, or devils through the agency of witches; and, in fact, it is
 evident that they do so.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it is to be noted that in all their methods of working injury
 they nearly always instruct witches to make their instruments of witchcraft
 by means of the Sacraments or sacramental things of the Church, or some holy
 thing consecrated to God: as when they sometimes place a waxen image under
 the Altar-cloth, or draw a thread through the Holy Chrism, or use some other
 consecrated thing in such a way. And there are three reasons for this.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For a similar reason they are wont to practise their witchcraft at the more
 sacred time of the year, especially at the  Advent of Our Lord, and at
 Christmas. First, that by such means they may make men guilty of not only
 perfidy, but also sacrilege, by contaminating whatever is divine in them;
 and that so they may the more deeply offend God their Creator, damn their
 own souls, and cause many more to rush into sin.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, that God, being so heavily offended by men, may grant the devil
 greater power of tormenting them. For so says S. Gregory, that in His anger
 He sometimes grants the wicked their prayers and petitions, which He
 mercifully denies to others. And the third reason is that, by the seeming
 appearance of good, he may more easily deceive certain simple men, who think
 that they have performed some pious act and obtained the grace from God,
 whereas they have only sinned the more heavily.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A fourth reason also can be added touching the more sacred seasons and the
 New Year. For, according to S. Augustine, there are other mortal sins
 besides adultery by which the observance of the Festivals may be infringed.
 Superstition, moreover, and witchcraft arising from the most servile
 operations of the devil are contrary to the reverence that is due to God.
 Therefore, as has been said, he causes a man to fall more deeply, and the
 Creator is the more offended.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And of the New Year we may say, according to S. Isidore, <i>Etym.</i> VIII.
 2, that Janus, from whom the month of January is named, which also begins
 on the Day of Circumcision, was an idol with two faces, as if one were the
 end of the old year and the other the beginning of the new, and, as it were,
 the protector and auspicious author of the coming year. And in honour of him,
 or rather of the devil in the form of that idol, the Pagans made much
 boisterous revelry, and were very merry among themselves, holding various
 dances and feasts. And concerning these Blessed Augustine makes mention in
 many places, and gives a very ample description of them in his Twenty-sixth
 Book.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And now bad Christians imitate these corruptions, turning them to
 lasciviousness when the run about at the time of
 Carnival with masks and jests and other
 superstitions. Similarly witches use these revelries of the devil for their
 own advantage, and work their spells about the time of the New Year in
 respect of the Divine Offices and Worship; as on S. Andrew's Day and at
 Christmas.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And now, as to how they work their witchcraft, first by means of the Sacraments,
 and then by means of sacramental objects, we will refer to a few known
 facts, discovered by us in the Inquisition.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In a town which it is better not to names, for the sake of charity and
 expediency, when a certain witch received the Body of Our Lord, she suddenly
 lowered her head, as is the detestable habit of women, placed her garment
 near her mouth, and taking the Body of the Lord out of her mouth, wrapped it
 in a handkerchief; and afterwards, at the suggestion of the devil, placed it
 in a pot in which there was a toad, and hid it in the ground near her house
 by the storehouse, together with several other things, by means of which she
 had to work her witchcraft. But with the help
 of God's mercy this great crime was detected and brought to light. For on
 the following day a workman was going on his business near that house, and
 heard a sound like a child crying; and when he had come near to the stone
 under which the pot had been hidden, he heard it much more clearly, and
 thinking that some child have been buried there by the woman, went to the
 Mayor or chief magistrate, and told him what had been done, as he thought,
 by the infanticide. And the Mayor quickly send his servants and found it to
 be as he had said. But they were unwilling to exhume the child, thinking it
 wiser to place a watch and wait to see if any woman came near the place; for
 they did not know that it was the Lord's Body that was hidden there. And so
 it happened that the same witch came to the place, and secretly hid to pot
 under her garment before their eyes. And when she was taken and questioned,
 she discovered her crime, saying that the Lord's Body had been hidden in the
 pot with a toad, so that by means of their dust she might be able to cause
 injuries at her will to men and other creatures.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is also to be noted that when witches communicate they observe this
 custom, that, when they can do so without being noticed, they receive the
 Lord's Body under their tongue instead of on the top. And as far as can be
 seen, the reason is that they never wish to receive any remedy that might
 counteract their abjuration of the Faith, either by Confession or by
 receiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist; and secondly, because in this way
 it is easier for them to take the Lord's Body out of their mouths so that
 they can apply it, as has been said, to their own uses, to the greater
 offence of the Creator.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For this reason all rectors of the Church and those who communicate the
 people are enjoined to take the utmost care when they communicate women that
 the mouth shall be well open and the tongue thrust well out, and their
 garments be kept quite clear. And the more care is taken in this respect,
 the more witches become known by this means.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Numberless other superstitions they practise by means of sacramental objects.
 Sometimes they place a waxen image or some aromatic substance under the
 altar cloth, as we said before, and then hide
 it under the threshold of a house, so that the person for whom it is placed
 there may be bewitched on crossing over it. Countless instances could be
 brought forward, but these minor sorts of spells are proved by the greater.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter VI</h2>
<h3>How Witches Impede and Prevent the Power of Procreation.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Concerning the method by which they obstruct the procreant function both in
 men and animals, and in both sexes, the reader my consult that which has
 been written already on the question, Whether devils can through witches
 turn the minds of men to love or hatred. There, after the solutions of the
 arguments, a specific declaration is made relating to the method by which,
 with God's permission, they can obstruct the procreant function.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it must be noted that such obstruction is caused both intrinsically and
 extrinsically. Intrinsically they cause it in two ways. First, when they
 directly prevent the erection of the member which is accomodated to
 fructification. And this need not seem impossible, when it is considered
 that they are able to vitiate the natural use of any member. Secondly, when
 they prevent the flow of the vital essences to the members in which resides
 the motive force, closing up the seminal ducts so that it does not reach
 the generative vessels, or so that it cannot be ejaculated, or is
 fruitlessly spilled.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Extrinsically they cause it at times by means of images, or by the eating of
 herbs; sometimes by other external means, such as cocks' testicles. But it
 must not be thought that it is by the virtue of these things that a man is
 made impotent, but by the occult power of devils' illusions witches by this
 means procure such impotence, namely, that they cause man to be unable to
 copulate, or a woman to conceive.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the reason for this is that God allows them more power over this act,
 by which the first sin was disseminated, than over other human actions.
 Similarly they have more power over serpents, which are the most subject
 to the influence of incantations, than over other animals. Wherefore it has
 often been found by us and other Inquisitors that they have caused this
 obstruction by means of serpents or some such things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For a certain wizard who had been arrested confessed that for many years he
 had by witchcraft brought sterility upon all the men and animals which
 inhabited a certain house. Moreover, Nider tells of a wizard named
 Stadlin who was taken in the diocese of
 Lausanne, and confessed that in a certain house where a man and his wife
 were loving, he had by his witchcraft successively killed in the woman's
 womb seven children, so that for many years the woman always miscarried. And
 that, in the same way, he had caused that all the pregnant cattle and
 animals of the house were during those years unable to give birth to any
 live issue. And when he was questioned as to how he had done this, and what
 manner of charge should be preferred against him, he discovered his crime,
 saying: I put a serpent under the threshold of the outer door of the house;
 and if this is removed, fecundity will be restored to the inhabitants. And
 it was as he said; for though the serpent was not found, having been
 reduced to dust, the whole piece of ground was removed, and in the same year
 fecundity was restored to the wife and to all the animals.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Another instance occurred hardly four years ago in Reichshofen. There was a
 most notorious witch, who could at all times and by a mere touch bewitch
 women and cause an abortion. Now the wife of a certain nobleman in that
 place had become pregnant and had engaged a midwife to take care of her, and
 had been warned by the midwife not to go out of the castle, and above all to
 be careful not to hold any speech or conversation with that witch. After
 some weeks, unmindful of that warning, she went out of the castle to visit
 some women who were met together on some festive occasion; and when she had
 sat down for a little, the witch came, and, as if for the purpose of
 saluting her, placed both her hands on her stomach; and suddenly she felt
 the child moving in pain. Frightened by this, she returned home and told the
 midwife what had happened. Then the midwife exclaimed: “Alas! you have
 already lost your child.” And so it proved when her time came; for she
 gave birth, not to an entire abortion, but little by little to separate
 fragments of its head and feet and hands. And the great affliction was
 permitted by God to punish her husband, whose duty it was to bring witches
 to justice and avenge their injuries to the Creator.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there was in the town of Mersburg in the diocese of Constance a certain
 young man who was bewitched in such a way that he could never perform the
 carnal act with any woman except one. And many have heard him tell that he
 had often wished to refuse that woman, and take flight to other lands; but
 that hitherto he had been compelled to rise up in the night and to come very
 quickly back, sometimes over land, and sometimes through the air as if he
 were flying.

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We have already shown that they can take away the male organ, not indeed by
 actually despoiling the human body of it, in the manner which we have already
 declared. And of this we shall instance a few examples.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the town of Ratisbon a certain young man who had an intrigue with a girl,
 wishing to leave her, lost his member; that is to say, some glamour was cast
 over it so that he could see or touch nothing but his smooth body. In his
 worry over this he went to a tavern to drink wine; and after he had sat
 there for a while he got into conversation with another woman who was there,
 and told her the cause of his sadness, explaining everything, and
 demonstrating in his body that it was so. The woman was astute, and asked
 whether he suspected anyone; and when he named such a one, unfolding the
 whole matter, she said: “If persuasion is not enough, you must use
 some violence, to induce her to restore to you your health.” So in the
 evening the young man watched the way by which the witch was in the habit of
 going, and finding her, prayed her to restore to him the health of his body.
 And when she maintained that she was innocent and knew nothing about it, he
 fell upon her, and winding a towel tightly about her neck, choked her,
 saying: “Unless you give me back my health, you shall die at my
 hands.” Then she, being unable to cry out, and growing black, said:
 “Let me go, and I will heal you.” The young man then relaxed
 the pressure of the towel, and the witch touched him with her hand between
 the thighs, saying: “Now you have what you desire.” And the
 young man, as he afterwards said, plainly felt, before he had verified it by
 looking or touching, that his member had been restored to him by the mere
 touch of the witch.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A similar experience is narrated by a certain venerable Father from the
 Dominican House of Spires, well known in the Order for the honest of his
 life and for his learning. “One day,” he says, “while I
 was hearing confessions, a young man came to me and, in the course of his
 confession, woefully said that he had lost his member. Being astonished at
 this, and not being willing to give it easy credence, since the opinion of
 the wise it is a mark of light-heartedness to believe too easily, I obtained
 proof of it when I saw nothing on the young man's removing his clothes and
 showing the place. Then, using the wisest counsel I could, I asked whether
 he suspected anyone of having so bewitched him. And the young man said that
 he did suspect someone, but that she was absent and living in Worms. Then I
 said: ‘I advise you to go to her as soon as possible and try your
 utmost to soften her with gentle words and promises’; and he did so.
 For he came back after a few days and thanked me, saying that he was whole
 and had recovered everything. And I believed his words, but again proved
 them by the evidence of my eyes.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there are some points to be noted for the clearer understanding of what
 has already been written concerning this matter. First, it must in no way
 be believed that such members are really torn right away from the body, but
 that they are hidden by the devil through some prestidigitory art so that
 they can be neither seen nor felt. And this is proved by the authorities and
 by argument; although is has been treated of before, where Alexander of
 Hales says that a Prestige, properly understood, is an illusion of the devil,
 which is not caused by any material change, but exists only in the perceptions
 of him who is deluded, either in his interior or exterior senses.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 With reference to these words it is to be noted that, in the case we are
 considering, two of the exterior senses, namely, those of sight and touch,
 are deluded, and not the interior senses, namely, common-sense, fancy,
 imagination, thought, and memory. (But S. Thomas says they are only four, as
 has been told before, reckoning fancy and imagination as one; and with some
 reason, for there is little difference between imagining and fancying. See
 S. Thomas, I, 79.) And these senses, and not only the exterior senses, are
 affected when it is not a case of hiding something, but the causing
 something to appear to a man either when he is aware or asleep.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As when a man who is awake sees things otherwise than as they are; such as
 seeing someone devour a horse with its rider, or thinking he sees a man
 transformed into a beast, or thinking that he is himself a beast and must
 associate with beasts. For then the exterior senses are deluded and are
 employed by the interior senses. For by the power of devils, with God's
 permission, mental images long retained in the treasury of such images,
 which is the memory, are drawn out, not from the intellectual understanding
 in which such images are stored, but from the memory, which is the repository
 of mental images, and is situated at the back of the head, and are presented
 to the imaginative faculty. And so strongly are they impressed on that
 faculty that a man has an inevitable impulse to imagine a horse or a beast,
 when the devil draws from the memory an image of a horse or a beast; and so
 he is compelled to think that he sees with his external eyes such a beast
 when there is actually no such beast to see; but it seems to be so by reason
 of the impulsive force of the devil working by means of those images.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it need not seem wonderful that devils can do this, when even a natural
 defect is able to effect the same result, as is shown in the case of frantic
 and melancholy men, and in maniacs and some drunkards, who are unable to
 discern truly. For frantic men think they see marvellous things, such as
 beasts and other horrors, when in actual fact they see nothing. See above,
 in the question, Whether witches can turn the minds of men to love and
 hatred; where many thing are noted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And, finally, the reason is self-evident. For since the devil has power over
 inferior things, except only the soul, therefore he is able to effect
 certain changes in those things, when God allows, so that things appear to
 be otherwise than they are. And this he does, as I have said, either by
 confusing and deluding the organ of sight so that a clear thing appears
 cloudy; just as after weeping, owing to the collected humours, the light
 appears to different from what it was before. Or by operating on the
 imaginative faculty by a transmutation of mental images, as has been said.
 Or by some agitation of various humours, so that matters which are earthy
 and dry seem to be fire or water: as some people make everyone in the house
 strip themselves naked under the impression that they are swimming in water.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It may be asked further with reference to the above method of devils, whether
 this sort of illusions can happen indifferently to the good and to the
 wicked: just as other bodily infirmities can, as will be shown later, be
 brought by witches even upon those who are in a state of grace. To this
 question, following the words of Cassian in his <i>Second Collation</i> of
 the Abbot Sirenus, we must answer that they cannot. And from this it follows
 that all who are deluded in this way are presumed to be in deadly sin. For
 he says, as is clear from the words of S. Antony: The devil can in no way
 enter the mind or body of any man, nor has the power to penetrate into the
 thoughts of anybody, unless such a person has first become destitute of all
 holy thoughts, and is quite bereft and denuded of spiritual contemplation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This agrees with Boethius where he says in the
 <i>Consolation of Philosophy:</i>
 We had given you such arms that, if you had not thrown them away, you would
 have been preserved from infirmity.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also Cassian tells in the same place of two Pagan witches, each in his own
 way malicious, who by their witchcraft sent a succession of devils into the
 cell of S. Antony for the purpose of driving him from there by their
 temptations; being infected with hatred for the holy man because a great
 number of people visited him every day. And though these devils assailed him
 with the keenest of spurs to his thoughts, yet he drove them away by crossing
 himself on the forehead and breast, and by prostrating himself in earnest
 prayer.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore we may say that all who are so deluded by devils, not reckoning
 any other bodily infirmities, are lacking in the gift of divine grace. And
 so it is said in <i>Tobias</i> vi: The devil has power against those who are
 subject to their lusts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This is also substantiated by what we told in the First Part in the question,
 Whether witches can change men into the shapes of beasts. For we told of a
 girl who was turned into a filly, as she herself and, except S. Macharius,
 all who looked at her were persuaded. But the devil could not deceive the
 senses of the holy man; and when she was brought to him to be healed, he saw
 true woman and not a horse, while on the other hand everyone else exclaimed
 that she seemed to be a horse. And the Saint, by his prayers, freed her and
 the others from that illusion, saying that this had happened to her because
 she had not attended sufficiently to holy things, nor used as she should
 Holy Confession and the Eucharist. And for this reason, because in her
 honesty she would not consent to the shameful proposal of a young man, who
 had caused a Jew who was a witch to bewitch the girl so that, by the power
 of the devil, he turned her into a filly.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We may summarize our conclusions as follows: - Devils can, for their profit
 and probation, injure the good in their fortunes, that is, in such exterior
 things as riches, fame, and bodily health. This is clear from the case of
 the Blessed Job, who was afflicted by the devil in such matters. But such
 injuries are not of their own causing, so that they cannot be led or driven
 into any sin, although they can be tempted both inwardly and outwardly in
 the flesh. But the devils cannot afflict the good with this sort of
 illusions, either actively or passively.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Not actively, but deluding their senses as they do those of others who are
 not in a state of grace. And not passively, by taking away their male organs
 by some glamour. For in these two respects they could never injure Job,
 especially in regard to the venereal act; for he was of such continence that
 he was able to say: I have vowed a vow with my eyes that I shall never think
 about a virgin, and still less about another man's wife. Nevertheless the
 devil knows that he has great power over sinners (see <i>S. Luke</i> xi:
 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace).<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be asked, as to illusions in respect of the male organ, whether,
 granted that the devil cannot impose this illusion on those in a state of
 grace in a passive way, he cannot still do so in an active sense: the
 argument being that the man in a state of grace is deluded because he ought
 to see the member in its right place, when he who thinks it has been taken
 away from him, as well as other bystanders, does not see in in its place;
 but if this is conceded, it seems to be contrary to what has been said. It
 can be said that there is not so much force in the active as in the passive
 loss; meaning by active loss, not his who bears the loss, but his who sees
 the loss from without, as is self-evident. Therefore, although a man in a
 state of grace can se the loss of another, and to that extent the devil can
 delude his senses; yet he cannot passively suffer such loss in his own body,
 as, for example, to be deprived of his member, since he is not subject to
 list. In the same way the converse is true, as the Angel said to Tobias:
 Those who are given to lust, the devil has power over them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And what, then, is to be thought of those witches who in this way sometimes
 collect male organs in great numbers, as many as twenty or thirty members
 together, and put them in a bird's nest, or shut them up in a box, where
 they move themselves like living members, and eat oats and corn, as has been
 seen by many and is a matter of common report? It is to be said that it is
 all done by devil's work and illusion, for the senses of those who see them
 are deluded in the way we have said. For a certain man tells that, when he
 had lost his member, he approached a known witch to ask her to restore it
 to him. She told the afflicted man to climb a certain tree, and that he
 might take which he liked out of the nest in which there were several
 members. And when he tried to take a big one, the witch said: You must not
 take that one; adding, because it belongs to a parish priest.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 All these things are caused by devils through an illusion or glamour, in the
 manner we have said, by confusing the organ of vision by transmuting the
 mental images in the imaginative faculty. And it must not be said that these
 members which are shown are devils in assumed members, just as they
 sometimes appear to witches and men in assumed aerial bodies, and converse
 with them. And the reason is that they effect this thing by an easier
 method, namely, by drawing out an inner mental image from the repository of
 the memory, and impressing it on the imagination.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if anyone wishes to say that they could go to work in a similar way,
 when they are said to converse with witches and other men in assumed bodies;
 that is, that they could cause such apparitions by changing the mental
 images in the imaginative faculty, so that when men thought the devils were
 present in assumed bodies, they were really nothing but an illusions caused
 by such a change of the mental images in the inner perceptions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is to be said that, if the devil had no other purpose than merely to
 show himself in human form, then there would be no need for him to appear in
 an assumed body, since he could effect his purpose well enough by the
 aforesaid illusion. But this is not so; for he has another purpose, namely,
 to speak and eat with them, and to commit other abominations. Therefore it
 is necessary that he should himself be present, placing himself actually in
 sight in an assumed body. For, as S. Thomas says, Where the Angel's power
 is, there he operates.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it may be asked, if the devil by himself and without any witch takes
 away anyone's virile member, whether there is any difference between one
 sort of deprivation and the other. In addition to what has been said in the
 First Part of this work on the question, Whether witches can take away a
 member, he does actually take it away, and it is actually restored when it
 has to be restored. Secondly, as it is not taken away without injury, so it
 is not without pain. Thirdly, that he never does this unless compelled by a
 good Angel, for by so doing he cuts off a great source of profit to him; for
 he knows that he can work more witchcraft on that act than on other human
 acts. For God permits him to do more injury to that than to other human acts,
 as has been said. But none of the above points apply when he works through
 the agency of a witch, with God's permission.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if it is asked whether the devil is more apt to injure men and creatures
 by himself than through a witch, it can be said that there is no comparison
 between the two cases. For he is infinitely more apt to do harm through the
 agency of witches. First, because he thus gives greater offence to God, by
 usurping to himself a creature dedicated to Him. Secondly, because when God
 is the more offended, He allows him the more power of injuring men. And
 thirdly, for his own gains, which he places in the perdition of souls.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>
<h3>Of the Manner whereby they Change Men into the Shapes of Beasts.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But that witches, by the power of devils, change men into the shapes of
 beasts (for this is their chief manner of transmutation), although it has
 been sufficiently proved in the First Part of the work, Question 10, Whether
 witches can do such things: nevertheless, since that question with its
 arguments and solutions may be rather obscure to some; especially since no
 actual examples are adduced to prove them, and even the method by which
 they so transform themselves is not explained; therefore we add the present
 exposition by the resolution of several doubts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And first, that Canon (26, Q. 5, Episcopi) is not to be understood in this
 matter in the way in which even many learned men (but would that their
 learning were good!) are deceived; who do not fear to affirm publicly in
 their sermons that such prestidigitatory transmutations are in no way possible
 even by the power of devils. And we have often said that this doctrine is
 greatly to the detriment of the Faith, and strengthens the witches, who
 rejoice very much in such sermons.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But such preachers, as has been noted, touch only the outer surface, and
 fail to reach the inner meaning of the words of the Canon. For when it says:
 Whoever believes that any creature can be made, or can be changed for the
 better or the worse, or be transformed into any other shape or likeness
 except by the Creator Himself Who made all, is without doubt an infidel. . . .<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The reader must here remark two chief things. First, concerning the words
 “be made”; and secondly, concerning the words “be
 transformed into another likeness.” And as to the first, it is
 answered that “be made” can be understood in two ways: namely,
 as meaning “be created,” or as in the sense of the natural
 production of anything. Now in the first sense it belongs only to God, as is
 well known, Who in His infinite might can make something out of nothing.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But in the second sense there is a distinction to be drawn between creatures;
 for some are perfect creatures, like a man, and an ass, etc. And other are
 imperfect, such as serpents, frogs, mice, etc., for they can also be
 generated from putrefaction. Now the Canon obviously speaks only of the
 former sort, not of the second; for in the case of the second it can be
 proved from what Blessed Albert says in his book <i>On Animals</i>, where he
 asks: whether devils can make true animals; and still with this difference,
 that they cannot do so in an instant, as God does, but by some motion,
 however sudden, as is shown in the case of the Magicians in <i>Exodus</i>
 vii. The reader may, if he likes, refer to some of the remarks in the
 question we have quoted in the First Part of the work, and in the solution
 of the first argument.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it is said that they cannot transmute any creature. You may say
 that transmutation is of two sorts, substantial and accidental; and this
 accidental is again of two kinds, consisting either in the natural form
 belonging to the thing which is seen, or in a form which does not belong to
 the thing which is seen, but exists only in the organs and perceptions of
 him who sees. The Canon speaks of the former, and especially of formal and
 actual transmutation, in which one substance is transmuted into another; and
 this sort only God can effect, Who is the Creator of such actual substances.
 And it speaks also of the second, although the devil can effect that, in so
 far as, with God's permission, he causes certain diseases and induces some
 appearance on the accidental body. As when a face appears to be leprous, or
 some such thing.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But properly speaking it is not such matters that are in question, but
 apparitions and glamours, by which things seem to be transmuted into other
 likenesses; and we say that the words of the Canon cannot exclude such
 transmutations; for their existence is proved by authority, by reason, and
 by experience; namely, by certain experiences related by S. Augustine in
 Book XVIII, chapter 17, of the <i>De Ciuitate Die</i>, and by the arguments
 in explanation of them. For among other prestidigitatory transformations, he
 mentions that the very famous Sorceress, Circe, changed the companions of
 Ulysses into beasts; and that certain innkeepers' wives had turned their
 guests into beasts of burden. He mentions also that the companions of
 Diomedes were changed into birds, and for a long time flew about the temple
 of Diomedes; and that Praestantius tells it for a fact that his father said
 that he had been a packhorse, and had carried corn with other animals.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now when the companions of Ulysses were changed into beasts, it was only in
 appearance, or deception of the eyes; for the animal shapes were drawn out
 of the repository or memory of images, and impressed on the imaginative
 faculty. And so imaginary vision was caused, and through the strong impression
 on the other senses and organs, the beholder thought that he saw animals, in
 the manner of which we have already treated. But how these things can be done
 by the devil's power without injury will be shown later.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But when the guests were changed into beasts of burden by the innkeepers'
 wives; and when the father of Praestantius thought he was a packhorse and
 carried corn; it is to be noted that in these cases there were three
 deceptions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First, that those men were caused by a glamour to seem to be changed into
 beasts of burden, and this change was caused in the way we have said.
 Second, that devils invisibly bore those burdens up when they were too heavy
 to be carried. Third, that those who seemed to others to be changed in shape
 seemed also to themselves to be changed into beasts; as it happened to
 Nabuchodonosor, who lived for seven years eating straw like
 an ox.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as to the comrades of Diomedes being changed into birds and flying round
 his temple, it is to be said that this Diomedes was one of the Greeks who
 went to the siege of Troy; and when he wished to return home, he was drowned
 with his comrades in the sea; and then, at the suggestion of some idol, a
 temple was built to him that he might be numbered among the gods; and for a
 long time, to keep that error alive, devils in the shape of birds flew about
 in place of his companions. Therefore that superstition was one of the
 glamours we have spoken of; for it was not caused by the impression of
 mental images on the imaginative faculty, but by their flying in the sight
 of men in the assumed bodies of birds.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if it is asked whether the devils could have deluded the onlookers by
 the above-mentioned method of working upon the mental images, and not by
 assuming aerial bodies like flying birds, the answer is that they could have
 done so.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For it was the opinion of some (as S. Thomas tells in the <i>Second Book of
 Sentences</i>, dist. 8, art. 2) that no Angel, good or bad, ever assumed a
 body; but that all that we read in the Scriptures about their appearances
 was caused by a glamour, or by the imaginary vision.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And here the learned Saint notes a difference between a glamour and
 imaginary vision. For in a glamour there may be an exterior object which is
 seen, but it seems other than it is. But imaginary vision does not necessarily
 require an exterior object, but can be caused without that and only by those
 inner mental images impressed on the imagination.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 So, following their opinion, the comrades of Diomedes were not represented
 by devils in the assumed bodies and likeness of birds, but only by a
 fantastic and imaginary vision caused by working upon those mental images,
 etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the learned Saint condemns this as an erroneous and not a simple
 opinion (though, it is piously believed, it is not actually heretical),
 although such appearances of good and bad Angels may at times have been
 imaginary, with no assumed body. But, as he says, the saints are agreed that
 the Angels also appeared to the actual sight, and such appearance was in an
 assumed body. And the scriptural text reads more as if it speaks of bodily
 appearance than imaginary or prestidigitatory ones. Therefore we can say for
 the present concerning any visions like that of the comrades of Diomedes:
 that although those comrades could by the devil's work have appeared in the
 imaginary vision of the beholders in the manner we have said, yet it is
 rather presumed that they were caused to be seen by devils in assumed aerial
 bodies like flying birds; or else that other natural birds were caused by
 devils to represent them.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter IX</h2>
<h3>How Devils may enter the Human Body and the Head without doing any Hurt, when they cause such Metamorphosis by Means of Prestidigitation.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Concerning the method of causing these illusory transmutations it may
 further be asked: whether the devils are then inside the bodies and heads
 of those who are deceived, and whether the latter are to be considered as
 possessed by devils; how it can happen without injury to the inner
 perceptions and faculties that a mental image is transferred from one inner
 faculty to another; and whether or not such work ought to be considered
 miraculous.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First we must again refer to a distinction between such illusory glamours;
 for sometimes the outer perceptions only are affected, and sometimes the
 inner perceptions are deluded and so affect the outer perceptions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the former case the glamour can be caused without the devils' entering
 into the outer perceptions, and merely by an exterior illusion; as when the
 interposition of some other body, or in some other way; or when he himself
 assumes a body and imposes himself on the vision.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But in the latter case it is necessary that he must first occupy the head
 and the faculties. And this is proved by authority and by reason.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is not a valid objection to say that two created spirits cannot be in
 one and the same place, and that the soul pervades the whole of the body.
 For on this question there is the authority of S. John Damascene, when he
 says: Where the Angel is, there he operates. And S. Thomas, in the
 <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>, dist. 7, art. 5, says: All Angels, good and
 bad, by their natural power, which is superior to all bodily power, are able
 to transmute our bodies.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this is clearly true, not only by reason of the superior nobility of
 their nature, but because the whole mechanism of the world and all corporeal
 creatures are administered by Angels; as S. Gregory says in the 4th Dialogue:
 In this visible world nothing can be disposed except by an invisible
 creature. Therefore all corporeal matters are governed by the Angels, who
 are also called, not only by the Holy Doctors but also by all the Philosophers,
 the Powers which move the stars. It is clear also from the fact that all
 human bodies are moved by their souls, just as all other matter is moved
 by the stars and the Powers which move them. Any who wish may refer to S.
 Thomas in the First Part, Quest. 90, art. 1.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this it is concluded that, since devils operates there where they are,
 therefore when they confuse the fancy and the inner perceptions they are
 existing in them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, although to enter the soul is possible only to God Who created it,
 yet devils can, with God's permission, enter our bodies; and they an then
 make impressions on the inner faculties corresponding to the bodily organs.
 And by those impressions the organs are affected in proportion as the inner
 perceptions are affected in the way which has been shown: that the devil
 can draw out some image retained in a faculty corresponding to one of the
 senses; as he draws from the memory, which is in the back part of the head,
 an image of a horse, and locally moves that phantasm to the middle part of
 the head, where are the cells of imaginative power; and finally to the sense
 of reason, which is in the front of the head. And he causes such a sudden
 change and confusion, that such objects are necessarily thought to be actual
 things seen with the eyes. This can be clearly exemplified by the natural
 defect in frantic men and other maniacs.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if it is asked how he can do this without causing pain in the head, the
 answer is easy. For in the first place he does not cause any actual physical
 change in the organs, but only moves the mental images. And secondly, he
 does not effect these changes by injecting any active quality which would
 necessarily cause pain, since the devil is himself without any corporeal
 quality, and can therefore operate without the use of any such quality.
 Thirdly, as has been said, he effects these transmutations only by a local
 movement from one organ to another, and not by other movements through which
 painful transformations are sometimes caused.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as for the objection that two spirits cannot separately exist in the
 same place, and that, since the soul exists in the head, how can a devil be
 there also? It is to be said that the soul is thought to reside in the
 centre of the heart, in which it communicates with all the members by an
 outpouring of life. An example can be taken from a spider, which feels in
 the middle of its web when any part of the web is touched.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 However, S. Augustine says in his book
 <i>On the Spirit and Soul</i>, that it is all
 in all, and all in every part of the body. Granting that the soul is in the
 head, still the devil can work there; for his work is different from the
 work of the soul. The work of the soul is in the body, to inform it and fill
 it with life; so that it exists not merely locally, but in the whole matter.
 But the devil works in such a part and such a place of the body, effecting
 his changes in respect of the mental images. Therefore, since there is no
 confusion between their respective operations, they can both exist together
 in the same part of the body.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is also the question whether such men are to be considered obsessed
 or frenzied, that is, possessed of devils. But this is considered separately;
 namely, whether it is possible through the work of witches for a man to be
 obsessed with a devil, that is, that the devil should actually and bodily
 possess him. And this question is specially discussed in the following
 chapter, since it has this special difficulty, namely, whether this can be
 caused through the operations of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But as to the question whether the temporal works of witches and devils are
 to be considered as miracles or of a miraculous nature; it is to be said
 that they are so, in so far as they are beyond the order of created nature
 as known to us, and are done by creatures unknown to us. But they are not
 properly speaking miracles as are those which are outside the whole of
 created nature; as are the miracles of God and the Saints. (See what was
 written in the First Part of this work, in the Fifth Question, in the
 refutation of the third error.)<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there are those who object that this sort of work must not be
 considered miracles, but simply works of the devil; since the purpose of
 miracles is the strengthening of the Faith, and they must not be conceded to
 the adversary of the Faith. And also because the signs of Antichrist are
 called lying signs by the Apostle.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First it is to be said that to work miracles is the gift of freely given
 grace. And they can be done by bad men and bad spirits, up to the limits of
 the power which is in them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore the miracles wrought by the good can be distinguished from those
 wrought by the wicked in at least three ways. First, the signs which are
 given by the good are done by Divine power in such matters as are beyond
 the capacity of their own natural power, such as raising the dead, and things
 of that sort, which the devils are not able to accomplish in truth, but only
 by an illusion: so Simon Magus moved the head of a dead man; but such
 manifestations cannot last long. Secondly, they can be distinguished by
 their utility; for the miracles of the good are of a useful nature, as the
 healing of sickness, and such things. But the miracles done by witches are
 concerned with harmful and idle things; as when they fly in the air, or
 benumb the limbs of men, or such things. And S. Peter assigns this difference
 in the <i>Itinerarium</i> of Clement.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third difference relates to the Faith. For the miracles of the good are
 ordained for the edification of the Faith and of good living; whereas the
 miracles of the wicked are manifestly detrimental to the Faith and to
 righteousness.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 They are distinguished also by the way in which they are done. For the good
 do miracles in a pious and reverent invocation of the Divine Name. But
 witches and wicked men work them by certain ravings and invocations of devils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there is no difficulty in the fact that the Apostle called the works of
 the devil and Antichrist lying wonders; for
 the marvels so done by Divine permission are true in some respects and
 false in others. They are true in so far as they are within the limits of
 the devil's power. But they are false when he appears to do things which are
 beyond his power, such as raising the dead, or making the blind to see. For
 when he appears to do the former, he either enters into the dead body or
 else removes it, and himself takes its place in an assumed aerial body; and
 in the latter case he takes away the sight by a glamour, and then suddenly
 restores it by taking away the disability he has caused, not by bringing
 light to the inner perceptions, as is told in the legend of Bartholomew.
 Indeed all the marvellous works of Antichrist and of witches can be said to
 be lying signs, insasmuch as their only purpose is to deceive. See S. Thomas,
 dist. 8, <i>de Uirtute Daemonum</i>.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We may also quote here the distinction which is drawn in the Compendium of
 Theological Truth between a wonder and a miracle. For in a miracle four
 conditions are required: that it should be done by God; that it should be
 beyond the existing order of nature; thirdly, that it should be manifest;
 and fourthly, that it should be for the corroboration of the Faith. But
 since the works of witches fail to fulfil at least the first and last
 conditions, therefore they may be called wonderful works, but nor miracles.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It can also be argued in this way. Although witches' works can in a sense
 be said to be miraculous, yet some miracles are supernatural, some
 unnatural, and some preternatural. And they are supernatural when they can
 be compared with nothing in nature, or in natural power, as when a virgin
 gives birth. They are unnatural when they are against the normal course of
 nature but do not overstep the limits of nature, such as causing the blind
 to see. And they are preternatural when they are done in a manner parallel
 to that of nature, as when rods are changed into serpents; for this can be
 done naturally also, through long putrefaction on account of seminal
 reasons; and thus the works of magicians may be said to be marvellous.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is expedient to recount an actual example, and then to explain it step
 by step. There is a town in the diocese of Strasburg, the name of which it
 is charitable and honourable to withhold, in which a workman was one day
 chopping some wood to burn in his house. A large cat suddenly appeared and
 began to attack him, and when he was driving it off, another even larger
 one came and attacked him with the first more fiercely. And when he again
 tried to drive them away, behold, three of them together attacked him,
 jumping up at his face, and biting and scratching his legs. In great fright
 and, as he said, more panic-stricken than he had ever been, he crossed
 himself and, leaving his work, fell upon the cats, which were swarming over
 the wood and again leaping at his face and throat, and with difficulty drove
 them away by beating one on the head, another on the legs, and another on
 the back. After the space of an hour, while he was again engaged upon his
 task, two servants of the town magistrates came and took him as a malefactor
 and led him into the presence of the bailiff or judge. And the judge,
 looking at him from a distance, and refusing to hear him, ordered him to be
 thrown into the deepest dungeon of a certain tower or prison, where those
 who were under sentence of death were placed. The man cried out, and for
 three days bitterly complained to the prison guards that he should suffer in
 that way, when he was conscious of no crime; but the more the guards tried
 to procure him a hearing, the more furious the judge became, expressing in
 the strongest terms his indignation that so great a malefactor had not yet
 acknowledged his crime, but dared to proclaim his innocence when the evidence
 of the facts proved his horrible crime. But although these could not prevail
 upon him, yet the judge was induced by the advice of the other magistrates
 to grant the man a hearing. So when he was brought out of prison into the
 presence of the judge, and the judge refused to look at him, the poor man
 threw himself before the knees of the other magistrates, pleading that he
 might know the reason for his misfortune; and the judge broke into these
 words: You most wicked of men, how can you not acknowledge your crime? At
 such a time on such a day you beat three respected matrons of this town, so
 that they lie in their beds unable to rise or to move. The poor man cast his
 mind back to the events of that day and that hour, and said: Never in all my
 life have I struck or beaten a woman, and I can prove by credible witnesses
 that at that time on that day I was busy chopping wood; and an hour
 afterwards your servants found me still engaged on that task. Then the
 judge again exclaimed in a fury: See how he tries to conceal his crime! The
 women are bewailing their blows, they exhibit the marks, and publicly
 testify that he struck them. Then the poor man considered more closely on
 that even, and said: I remember that I struck some creatures at that time,
 but they were not women. The magistrates in astonishment asked him to relate
 what sort of creatures he had struck; and he told, to their great
 amazement, all that had happened, as we have related it. So, understanding
 that it was the work of the devil, they released the poor man and let him
 go away unharmed, telling him not to speak of this matter to anyone. But it
 could not be hidden from those devout persons present who were zealous for
 the Faith.

<h2>Chapter X</h2>
<h3>Of the Method by which Devils through the Operations of Witches sometimes actually possess men.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It has been shown in the previous chapter how devils can enter the heads
 and other parts of the body of men, and can move the inner mental images
 from place to place. But someone may doubt whether they are able at the
 instance of witches to obsess men entirely; or fell some uncertainty about
 their various methods of causing such obsession without the instance of
 witches. And to clear up these doubts we must undertake three explanations.
 First, as to the various methods of possession. Secondly, how at the
 instance of witches and with God's permission devils at time possess men
 in all those ways. Thirdly, we must substantiate our arguments with facts
 and examples.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 With references to the first, we must make an exception of that general
 method by which the devil inhabits a man in any mortal sin. S. Thomas, in
 Book 3, quest. 3, speaks of this method where he considers the doubt
 whether the devil always substantially possesses a man when he commits
 mortal sin; and the reason for the doubt is that the indwelling Holy Ghost
 always forms a man with grace, according to I. <i>Corinthians</i>, iii: Ye
 are the temple of God, and the spirit of God dwelleth in you. And, since
 guilt is opposed to grace, it would seem that there were opposing forces
 in the same place.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there he proves that to possess a man can be understood in two ways:
 either with regard to the soul, or with regard to the body. And in the first
 way it is not possible for the devil to possess the soul, since God alone
 can enter that; therefore the devil is not in this way the cause of sin,
 which the Holy Spirit permits the soul itself to commit; so there is no
 similitude between the two.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But as to the body, we may say that the devil can possess a man in two ways,
 just as there are two classes of men: those who are in sin, and those who
 are in grace. In the first way, we may say that, since a man is by any
 mortal sin brought into the devil's service, in so far as the devil provides
 the outer suggestion of sin either to the senses or to the imagination, to
 that extent he is said to inhabit the character of a man when he is moved
 by every stirring temptation, like a ship in the sea without a rudder.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The devil can also essentially possess a man as is clear in the case of
 frantic men. But this rather belongs to the question of punishment than that
 of sin, as will be shown; and bodily punishments are not always the
 consequence of sin, but are inflicted now upon sinners and now upon the
 innocent. Therefore both those who are and those who are not in a state of
 grace can, in the depth of the incomprehensible judgement of God, be
 essentially possessed by devils. And though this method of possession is not
 quite pertinent to our inquire, we have set it down lest it should seem
 impossible to anyone that, with God's permission, men should at times be
 substantially inhabited by devils at the instance of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We may say, therefore, that just as there are five ways in which devils by
 themselves, without witches, can injure and possess men, so they can also do
 so in those ways at the instance of witches; since then God is the more
 offended, and greater power of molesting men is allowed to the devil through
 witches. And the methods are briefly the following, excepting the fact that
 they sometimes plague a man through his external possessions: sometimes they
 injure men only in their own bodies; sometimes in their and in their
 faculties; sometimes they only tempt them inwardly and outwardly; others
 they at times deprive of the use of their reason; others they change into
 the appearance of irrational beasts. We shall speak of these methods singly.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But first we shall rehearse five reasons why God allows men to be possessed,
 for the sake of preserving a due order in our matter. For sometimes a man is
 possessed for his own advantage; sometimes for a slight sin of another; and
 sometimes for his own venial sin; sometimes for another's heavy sin. For all
 these reasons let no one doubt that God allows such things to be done by
 devils at the instance of witches; and it is better to prove each of them by
 the Scriptures, rather than by recent examples, since new things are always
 strengthened by old examples.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For an example of the first is clearly shown in the <i>Dialogue</i> of
 Severus, a very dear disciple of S. Martin, where
 he tells that a certain Father of very holy life was so gifted by grace with
 the power of expelling devils, that they were put to flight not only by his
 words, but even by his letters or his hair-shirt. And since the Father
 became very famous in the world, and felt himself tempted with vainglory,
 although he manfully resisted that vice, yet, that he might be the more
 humiliated, he prayed with his whole heart to God that he might be for five
 months possessed by a devil; and this was done. For he was at once possessed
 and had to be put in chains, and everything had to applied to him which is
 customary in the case of demoniacs. But at the end of the fifth month he was
 immediately delivered both from all vainglory and from the devil. But we
 do not read, nor is it for the present maintained, that for this reason a
 man can be possessed by a devil through the witchcraft of another man;
 although, as we have said, the judgements of God are incomprehensible.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the second reason, when someone is possessed because of the light sin of
 another, S. Gregory gives an example. The Blessed Abbot Eleutherius, a most
 devout man, was spending the night near a convent of virgins, who unknown to
 him ordered to be put by his cell a young boy who used to be tormented all
 night by the devil. But on that same night the boy was delivered from the
 devil by the presence of the Father. When the Abbot learned of this, and the
 boy now being placed in the holy man's monastery, after many days he began
 to exult rather immoderately over the boy's liberation, and said to his
 brother monks: The devil was playing his pranks with those Sisters, but he
 had not presumed to approach this boy since he came to the servants of God.
 And behold! the devil at once began to torment the boy. And by the tears and
 fasting of the holy man and his brethren he was with difficulty delivered,
 but on the same day. And indeed that an innocent person should be possessed
 for the slight fault of another is not surprising when men are possessed by
 devils for their own light fault, or for another's heavy sin, or for their
 own heavy sin, and some also at the instance of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Cassia, in his <i>First Collation</i> of the Abbot Serenus, gives an
 example of how one Moses was possessed for his own venial sin. This Moses,
 he says, was a hermit of upright and pious life; but because on one occasion
 he engaged in a dispute with the Abbot Macharius, and went a little too far
 in the expression of a certain opinion, he was immediately delivered up to
 a terrible devil, who caused him to void his natural excrements through his
 mouth. And that this scourge was inflicted by God for the sake of purgation,
 lest any stain of his momentary fault should remain in him, is clear from
 his miraculous cure. For by continual prayers and submission to the Abbot
 Macharius, the vile spirit was quickly driven away and departed from him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A similar case is that related by S. Gregory in his <i>First Dialogue</i> of
 the nun who ate a lettuce without having first made the sign of the Cross,
 and was set free by the Blessed Father Equitius.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the same <i>Dialogue</i> St. Gregory tells an example of the fourth case,
 where someone in possessed because of the heavy sin of another. The Blessed
 Bishop Fortunatus had driven the devil from a possessed man, and the devil
 began to walk about the streets of the city in the guise of a pilgrim,
 crying out: Oh, the holy man Bishop Fortunatus! See, he has cast me, a
 pilgrim, out of my lodging, and I can find no rest anywhere. Then a certain
 man sitting with his wife and son invited the pilgrim to lodge with him, and
 asking why he had been turned out, was delighted with the derogatory story
 of the holy man which the pilgrim had invented. And thereupon the devil
 entered his son, and cast him upon the fire, and killed him. And then for
 the first time did the unhappy father understand whom he had received as a
 guest.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And fifthly, we read many examples of men being possessed for their own
 heavy sin, both in the Holy Scripture and in the passions of the Saints.
 For in I. <i>Kings</i> xv, Saul was possessed for disobedience to God. And,
 as we have said, we have mentioned all these so that it need not seem to
 anyone impossible that men should also be possessed because of the crimes of,
 and at the instance of, witches. And we shall be able to understand the
 various methods of such possession by quoting actual examples.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the time of Pope Pius II the following
 was the experience of one of us two Inquisitors before he entered upon his
 office in the Inquisition. A certain Bohemian from the town of Dachov
 brought his only son, a secular priest, to Rome to be delivered, because he
 was possessed. It happened that I, one of us Inquisitors, went into a
 refectory, and that priest and his father came and sat down at the same
 table with me. We saluted each other, and talked together, as is customary;
 and the father kept sighing and praying Almighty God that his journey might
 prove to have been successful. I felt great pity for him, and began to ask
 what was the reason of his journey and of his sorrow. Then he, in the
 hearing of his son who was sitting next to me at the table, answered:
 “Alas! I have a son possessed by a devil, and with great trouble and
 expense I have brought him here to be delivered.” And when I asked
 where the son was, he showed me him sitting by my side. I was a little
 frightened, and looked at him closely; and because he took his food with
 such modesty, and answered piously to all questions, I began to doubt that
 he was not possessed, but that some infirmity had happened to him. Then the
 son himself told what had happened, showing how and for how long he had been
 possessed, and saying: “A certain witch brought this evil upon me. For
 I was rebuking her on some matter concerned with the discipline of the
 Church, upbraiding her rather strongly since she was of an obstinate
 disposition, when she said that after a few days that would happen to me
 which has happened. And the devil which possesses me has told me that a
 charm was placed by the witch under a certain tree, and that until it was
 removed I could not be delivered; but he would not tell me which was the
 tree.” But I would not in the least have believed his words if he had
 not at once informed me of the facts of the case. For when I asked him about
 the length of the intervals during which he had the use of his reason more
 than is usual in the case of persons possessed, he answered: “I am
 only deprived of the use of my reason when I wish to contemplate
 holy things
 or to visit sacred places. For the devil specifically told me in his own
 words uttered through my mouth that, because he had up to that time been
 much offended by my sermons to the people, we would in no way allow me to
 preach.” For according to his father, he was a preacher full of grace,
 and loved by all. But I, the Inquisitor, wishing for proofs, had him taken
 for a fortnight and more to various holy places, and especially to the
 Church of S. Praxedes the Virgin, where there
 is part of the marble pillar to which Our Saviour was bound when He was
 scourged, and to the place where S. Peter the Apostle was crucified; and in
 all these places he uttered horrible cries while he was being exorcised,
 now saying that he wished to come forth, and after a little maintaining the
 contrary. And as we have said before, in all his behaviour he remained a
 sober priest without any eccentricity, except during the process of any
 exorcisms; and when these were finished, and the stole was taken from his
 neck, he showed no sign of madness or any immoderate action. But when he
 passed any church, and genuflected in honour of the Glorious Virgin, the
 devil made him thrust his tongue far out of his mouth; and when he was
 asked whether he could not restrain himself from doing this, he answered:
 “I cannot help myself at all, for so he uses all my limbs and organs,
 my neck, my tongue, and my lungs, whenever he pleases, causing me to speak
 or to cry out; and I hear the words as if they were spoken by myself, but I
 am altogether unable to restrain them; and when I try to engage in prayer
 he attacks me more violently, thrusting out my tongue.” And there was
 in the Church of S. Peter a column brought from Solomon's Temple, by virtue
 of which many who are obsessed with devils are liberated, because Christ
 had stood near it when He preached in the Temple; but even here he could not
 be delivered, owing to the hidden purpose of God which reserved another
 method for his liberation. For though he remained shut in by the column for
 a whole day and night, yet on the following day, after various exorcisms
 had been performed upon him, with a great concourse of people standing round,
 he was asked by which part of the column Christ had stood; and he bit the
 column with his teeth, and, crying out, showed the place, saying: “Here
 He stood! Here He stood!” And at last he said, “I will not go
 forth.” And when he was asked why, he answered in the Italian tongue
 (although the poor priest did not understand that language), They all
 practise such and such things, naming the worst vice of lustfulness. And
 afterwards the priest asked me, saying, “Father, what did those Italian
 words mean which came from my mouth?” And when I told him, he
 answered, “I heard the words, but I could not understand them.”
 Eventually it proved that this demoniac was of that sort of which the
 Saviour spoke in the Gospel, saying: This sort goeth not out save by prayer
 and fasting. For a venerable Bishop, who had been driven from his see by the
 Turks, piously took compassion on him, and by fasting on bread and water for
 forty days, and by prayers and exorcisms, at last through the grace of God
 delivered him and sent him back to his home rejoicing.

<h2>Chapter XI</h2>
<h3>Of the Method by which they can Inflict Every Sort of Infirmity, generally Ills of the Graver Kind.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there is no bodily infirmity, not even leprosy or epilepsy, which cannot
 be caused by witches, with God's permission. And this is proved by the fact
 that no sort of infirmity is excepted by the Doctors. For a careful
 consideration of what has already been written concerning the power of
 devils and the wickedness of witches will show that this statement offers
 no difficulty. Nider also deals with this subject both in his
 <i>Book of Precepts</i> and in his
 <i>Formicarius</i>, where he asks: Whether witches can actually injure men
 by their witchcraft. And the question makes no exception of any infirmity,
 however incurable. And he there answers that they can do so, and proceeds
 to ask in what way and by what means.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as to the first, he answers, as has been shown in the First Question of
 the First Part of this treatise. And it is proved also by S. Isidore where
 he describes the operations of witches (<i>Etym.</i> 8, cap. 9), and says
 that they are called witches on account of the magnitude of their crimes;
 for they disturb the elements by raising up storms with the help of devils,
 they confuse the minds of men in the ways already mentioned, by either
 entirely obstructing or gravely impeding the use of their reason. He adds
 also that without the use of any poison, but by the mere virulence of their
 incantations, they can deprive men of their lives.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is proved also by S. Thomas in the <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>, dist.
 7 and 8, and in Book IV, dist. 34, and in general all the Theologians write
 that witches can with the help of the devil bring harm upon men and their
 affairs in all the ways in which the devil alone can injure or deceive,
 namely, in their affairs, their reputation, their body, their reason, and
 their life; which means that those injuries which are caused by the devil
 without any witch, can also be caused by a witch; and even more readily so,
 on account of the greater offence which is given to the Divine Majesty, as
 has been shown above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In <i>Job</i> i and ii is found a clear case of the injury in temporal
 affairs. The injury to reputation is shown in the history of the Blessed
 Jerome, that the devil transformed himself into the appearance of S.
 Silvanus, Bishop of Nazareth, a friend of S. Jerome. And this devil
 approached a noble woman by night in her bed and began first to provoke and
 entice her with lewd words, and then invited her to perform the sinful act.
 And when she called out, the devil in the form of the saintly Bishop hid
 under the woman's bed, and being sought for and found there, he in lickerish
 language declared lyingly that he was the Bishop Silvanus. On the morrow
 therefore, when the devil had disappeared, the holy man was scandalously
 defamed; but his good name was cleared when the devil confessed at the tomb
 of S. Jerome that he had done this in an assumed body.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The injury to the body is shown in the case of the Blessed Job, who was
 stricken by the devil with terrible sores, which are explained as a form of
 leprosy. And Sigisbert and Vincent of
 Beauvais (<i>Spec. Hist.</i> XXV, 37) both tell that in the time of the
 Emperor Louis II, in the diocese of Mainz, a
 certain devil began to thrown stones and to beat at the houses as if with a
 hammer. And then by public statements, and secret insinuations, he spread
 discord ad troubled the minds of many. Then he excited the anger of all
 against one man, whose lodging, where he was resting, he set on fire, and
 said that they were all suffering for his sins. So at last that man had to
 find his lodging in the fields. And when the priests were saying a litany
 on this account, the devil stoned many of the people with stones till he
 hurt them to bleeding; and sometimes he would desist, and sometimes rage;
 and this continued for three years, until all the houses there were burned
 down.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Exampled of the injury to the use of the reason, and of the tormenting of
 the inner perceptions, are seen in those possessed and frenzied men of whom
 the Gospels tell. And as for death, and that they deprive some of their
 lives, it is proved in <i>Tobias</i> vi, in the case of the seven husbands
 of the virgin Sara, who were killed because of their lecherous lust and
 unbridled desired for the virgin Sara, of whom they were not worthy to be
 the husbands. Therefore it is concluded that both by themselves, and all the
 more with the help of witches, devils can injure men in every way without
 exception.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if it is asked whether injuries of this sort are to be ascribed rather
 to devils than to witches, it is answered that, when the devils cause
 injuries by their own direct action, then they are principally to be
 ascribed to them. But when they work through the agency of witches for the
 disparagement and offending of God and the perdition of souls, knowing that
 by this means God is made more angry and allows them greater power of doing
 evil; and because they do indeed perpetuate countless witchcrafts which the
 devil would not be allowed to bring upon men if he wished to injure men
 alone by himself, but are permitted, in the just and hidden purpose of God,
 through the agency of witches, on account of their perfidy and abjuration
 of the Catholic Faith; therefore such injuries are justly ascribed to
 witches secondarily, however much the devil may be the principal actor.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore when a woman dips a twig in water and sprinkles the water in the
 air to make it rain, although she does not herself cause the rain, and
 could not be blamed on that account, yet, because she has entered into a
 pact with the devil by which she can do this as a witch, although it is the
 devil who causes the rain, she herself nevertheless deservedly bears the
 blame, because she is an infidel and does the devil's work, surrendering
 herself to his service.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 So also when a witch makes a waxen image or some such thing in order to
 bewitch somebody; or when an image of someone appears by pouring molten
 lead into water, and some injury is done upon the image, such as piercing it
 or hurting it in any other way, when it is the bewitched man who is in
 imagination being hurt; although the injury is actually done to the image
 by some witch or some other man, and the devil in the same manner invisibly
 injures the bewitched man, yet it is deservedly ascribed to the witch. For,
 without her, God would never allow the devil to inflict the injury, nor
 would the devil on his own account try to injure the man.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But because it has been said that in the matter of their good name the
 devils can injure men on the own account and without the co-operation of
 witches, there may arise a doubt whether the devils cannot also defame
 honest women so that they are reputed to be witches, when they appear in
 their likeness to bewitch someone; from which it would happen that such a
 woman would be defamed without cause.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In answering this we must premise a few remarks. First, it has been said
 that the devil can do nothing without the Divine permission, as is shown in
 the First Part of this work in the last Question. It has also been shown
 that God does not allow so great power of evil against the just and those
 who live in grace, as against sinners; and as the devils have more power
 against sinners (see the text: When a strong man
 armed, etc.) so they are permitted by God to afflict them more than the
 just. Finally, although they can, with God's permission, injure the just in
 their affairs, their reputation, and their bodily health, yet, because they
 know that this power is granted them chiefly for the increase of the merits
 of the just, they are the less eager to injure them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore it can be said that in this difficulty there are several points to
 be considered. First, the Divine permission. Secondly, the man who is
 thought to be righteous, for they who are so reputed are not always actually
 in a state of grace. Thirdly, the crime of which an innocent man would be
 suspected; for that crime in its very origin exceeds all the crimes of the
 world. Therefore it is to be said that it is granted that, with God's
 permission, an innocent person, whether or not he is in a state of grace,
 may be injured in his affairs to this particular crime and the gravity of
 the accusation (for we have often quoted S. Isidore's saying that they
 are called witches from the magnitude of their crimes), it can be said that
 for an innocent person to be defamed by the devil in a way that has been
 suggested does not seem at all possible, for many reasons.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the first place, it is one thing to be defamed in respect of vices which
 are committed without any expressed or tacit contract with the devil, such
 as theft, robbery, or fornication; but quite another matter to be defamed
 in respect of vices which it is impossible to accuse a man of having
 perpetrated unless he has entered upon an expressed contract with the
 devil; and such are the works of witches, which cannot be laid at their
 door unless it is by the power of devils that they bewitch men, animals and
 the fruits of the earth. Therefore, although the devil can blacken men's
 reputations in respect of other vices, yet it does not seem possible for him
 to do so in respect of this vice which cannot be perpetrated without his
 co-operation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, it has never hitherto been known to have happened that an innocent
 person has been defamed by the devil to such an extent that he was
 condemned to death for this particular crime. Furthermore, when a person is
 only under suspicion, he suffers no punishment except that which the Canon
 prescribes for his purgation, as will be shown in the Third Part of this
 work in the second method of sentencing witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is set down there that, if such a man fails in his purgation, he is
 to be considered guilty, but that he should be solemnly adjured before the
 punishment due to his sin is proceeded with and enforced. But here we are
 dealing with actual events; and it has never yet been known that an
 innocent person has been punished on suspicion of witchcraft, and there is
 no doubt that God will never permit such a thing to happen.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, He does not suffer the innocent who are under Angelic protection
 to be suspected of smaller crimes, such as robbery and such things; then all
 the more will He preserve those who are under that protection from
 suspicion of the crime of witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is no valid objection to quote the legend of S. Germanius, when
 devils assumed the bodies of other women and sat down at table and slept
 with the husbands, deluding the latter into the belief that those women were
 in their own bodies eating and drinking with them, as we have mentioned
 before. For the women in this case are not to be held guiltless. For in the
 Canon (<i>Episcopi</i> 26. q. 2) such women are condemned for thinking that
 they are really and actually transported, when they are so only in
 imagination; although, as we have shown above, they are at times bodily
 transported by devils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But our present proposition is that they can, with God's permission, cause
 all other infirmities, with no exception; and it is to be concluded from
 what we have said that this is so. For no exception is made by the Doctors,
 and there is no reason why there should be any, since, as we have often
 said, the natural power of devils is superior to all corporeal power. And
 we have found in our experience that this is true. For although greater
 difficulty may be felt in believing that witches are able to cause leprosy
 or epilepsy, since these diseases arise from some long-standing physical
 predisposition or defect, none the less it has sometimes been found that
 even these have been caused by witchcraft. For in the diocese of Basel, in
 the district of Alsace and Lorraine, a certain honest labourer spoke roughly
 to a certain quarrelsome woman, and she angrily threatened him that she
 would soon avenge herself on him. He took little notice of her; but on the
 same night he felt a pustule grow upon his neck, and he rubbed it a little,
 and found his whole face and neck puffed up and swollen, and a horrible form
 of leprosy appeared all over his body. He immediately went to his friends
 for advice, and told them of the woman's threat, and said that he would
 stake his life on the suspicion that this had been done to him by the magic
 art of that same witch. In short, the woman was taken, questioned, and
 confessed her crimes. But when the judge asked her particularly about the
 reason for it, and how she had done it, she answered: “When that man
 used abusive words to me, I was angry and went home; and my familiar began
 to ask the reason for my ill humour. I told him, and begged him to avenge
 me on the man. And he asked what I wanted him to do to him; and I answered
 that I wished he would always have a swollen face. And the devil went away
 and afflicted the man even beyond my asking; for I had not hoped that he
 would infect him with such sore leprosy.” And so the woman was
 burned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And in the diocese of Constance, between Breisach and Freiburg, there is a
 leprous woman (unless she has paid the debt of all flesh within these two
 years) who used to tell to many people how the same thing had happened to
 her by reason of a similar quarrel which took place between her and another
 woman. For one night when she went out of the house to do something in front
 of the door, a warm wind came from the house of the other woman, which was
 opposite, and suddenly struck her face; and from that time she had been
 afflicted with the leprosy which she now suffered.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And lastly, in the same diocese, in the territory of the Black Forest, a
 witch was being lifted by a gaoler on to the pile of wood prepared for her
 burning, and she said: ”I will pay you”; and blew into his face.
 And he was at once afflicted with a horrible leprosy all over his body, and
 did not survive many days. For the sake of brevity, the fearful crimes of
 this witch, and many more instances could be recounted, are omitted. For we
 have often found that certain people have been visited with epilepsy or the
 falling sickness by means of eggs which have been buried with dead bodies,
 especially the dead bodies of witches, together with other ceremonies of
 which we cannot speak, particularly when these eggs have been given to a
 person either in food or drink.

<h2>Chapter XII</h2>
<h3>Of the Way how in Particular they Afflict Men with Other Like Infirmities.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But who can reckon the number of infirmities which they have inflicted upon
 men, such as blindness, the sharpest pains, and contortions of the body?
 Yet we shall set down a few examples which we have seen with our eyes, or
 have been related to one of us Inquisitors.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 When an inquisition was being held on some witches in the town of Innsbruck,
 the following case, among others, was brought to light. A certain honest
 woman who had been legally married to one of the household of the Archduke
 formally deposed the following. In the time of her maidenhood she had been
 in the service of one of the citizens, whose wife became afflicted with
 grievous pains in the head; and a woman came who said she could cure her,
 and so began certain incantations and rites which she said would assuage the
 pains. And I carefully watched (said this woman) what she did, and saw that,
 against the nature of water poured into a vase, she caused water to rise in
 its vessel, together with other ceremonies which there is no need to mention.
 And considering that the pains in my mistress' head were not assuaged by
 these means, I addressed the witch in some indignation with these words:
 “I do not know what you are doing, but whatever it is, it is witchcraft,
 and you are doing it for your own profit.” Then the witch at once
 replied: “You will know in three days whether I am a witch or not.”
 And so it proved; for on the third day when I sat down and took up a spindle,
 I suddenly felt a terrible pain in my body. First it was inside me, so that
 it seemed that there was no part of my body in which I did not feel horrible
 shooting pains; then it seemed to me just as if burning coals were being
 continually heaped upon my head; thirdly, from the crown of my head to the
 soles of my feet there was no place large enough for a pinprick that was not
 covered with a rash of white pustules; and so I remained in these pains,
 crying out and wishing only for death, until the fourth day. At last my
 mistress' husband told me to go to a certain tavern; and with great
 difficulty I went, whilst he walked before, until we were in front of the
 tavern. “See!” he said to me; “there is a loaf of white
 bread over the tavern door.” “I see,” said I. Then he said:
 “Take it down, if you possibly can, for it may do you good.” And
 I, holding on to the door with one hand as much as I could, got hold of the
 loaf with the other. “Open it” (said my master) “and look
 carefully at what is inside.” Then, when I had broken open the loaf,
 I found many things inside it, especially some white grains very like the
 pustules on my body; and I saw also some seeds and herbs such as I could not
 eat or even look at, with the bones of serpents and other animals. In my
 astonishment I asked my master what was to be done; and he told me to throw
 it all into the fire. I did so; and behold! suddenly, not in an hour or even
 a few minutes, but at the moment when that matter was thrown into the fire,
 I regained all my former health.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And much more was deposed against the wife of the citizen in whose service
 this woman had been, by reason of which she was not lightly but very
 strongly suspected, and especially because she had used great familiarity
 with known witches. It is presumed that, having knowledge of the spell of
 witchcraft hidden in the loaf, she had told it to her husband; and then, in
 the way described, the maid-servant recovered her health.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To bring so great a crime into detestation, it is well that we should tell
 how another person, also a woman, was bewitched in the same town. An honest
 married woman deposed the following an oath.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Behind my house (she said) I have a greenhouse, and my neighbour's garden
 borders on it. One day I noticed that a passage had been made from my
 neighbour's garden to my greenhouse, not without some damage being cause;
 and as I was standing in the door of my greenhouse reckoning to myself and
 bemoaning both the passage and the damage, my neighbour suddenly came up and
 asked if I suspected her. But I was frightened because of her bad reputation,
 and only answered, “The footprints on the grass are proof of the
 damage.” Then she was indignant because I had not, as she hoped,
 accused her with the actionable words, and went away murmuring; and though
 I could hear her words, I could not understand them. After a few days I
 became very ill with pains in the stomach, and the sharpest twinges shooting
 from my left side to my right, and conversely, as if two swords or knives
 were thrust through my breast; whence day and night I disturbed all the
 neighbours with my cries. And when they came from all sides to console me,
 it happened that a certain clay-worker, who was engaged in an adulterous
 intrigue with the witch, my neighbour, coming to visit me, took pity on my
 illness, and after a few words of comfort went away. But the next day he
 returned in a hurry, and, after consoling me, added: “I am going to
 test whether your illness is due to witchcraft, and if I find that it is, I
 shall restore your health.” So he took some molten lead and, while I
 was lying in bed, poured it into a bowl of water which he placed on my body.
 And when the lead solidified into a certain image and various shapes, he
 said: “See! your illness has been caused by witchcraft; and one of the
 instruments of that witchcraft is hidden under the threshold of your house
 door. Let us go, then, and remove it, and you will feel better.” So my
 husband and he went to remove the charm; and the clay-worker, taking up the
 threshold, told my husband to put his hand into the hold which then appeared,
 and take out whatever he found; and he did so. And first he brought out a
 waxen image about a palm long, perforated all over, and pierced through the
 sides with two needles, just in the same way that I felt the stabbing pains
 from side to side; and then little bags containing all sorts of things, such
 as grains and seeds and bones. And when all these things were burned, I
 became better, but not entirely well. For although the shootings and twinges
 stopped, and I quite regained my appetite for food, yet even now I am by no
 means fully restored to health. — And when we asked her why it was
 that she had not been completely restored, she answered: There are some
 other instruments of witchcraft hidden away which I cannot find. And when I
 asked the man how he knew where the first instruments were hidden, he
 answered: “I knew this through the love which prompts a friend to tell
 things to a friend; for your neighbour revealed this to me when she was
 coaxing me to commit adultery with her.” This is the story of the
 sick woman.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if I were to tell all the instances that were found in that one town I
 should need to make a book of them. For countless men and women who were
 blind, or lame, or withered, or plagued with various infirmities, severally
 took their oath that they had strong suspicions that their illnesses, both
 in general and in particular, were caused by witches, and that they were
 bound to endure those ills either for a period or right up to their deaths.
 And all that they said and testified was true, either as regards a specified
 illness or as regards a specified illness or as regards the death of others.
 For that country abounds in henchmen and knights who have leisure for vice,
 and seduce women, and then wish to cast them off when they desire to marry
 an honest woman. But they can rarely do this without incurring the
 vengeance of some witchcraft upon themselves or their wives. For when those
 women see themselves despised, they persist in tormenting not so much the
 husband as the wife, in the fond hope that, if the wife should die, the
 husband would return to his former mistress.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For when a cook of the Archduke had married an honest girl from a foreign
 country, a witch, who had been his mistress, met them in the public road and,
 in the hearing of other honest people, foretold the bewitching and death of
 the girl, stretching out her hand and saying: “Not for long will you
 rejoice in your husband.” And at once, on the following day, she took
 to her bed, and after a few days paid the debt of all flesh, exclaiming just
 as she expired: Lo! thus I die, because that woman, with God's permission,
 has killed me by her witchcraft; yet verily I go to another and better
 marriage with God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the same way, according to the evidence of public report, a certain
 soldier was slain by witchcraft, and many others whom I omit to mention.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But among them there was a well-known gentleman, whom his mistress wished
 to come to her on one occasion to pass the night; but he sent his servant
 to tell her that he could not visit her that night because he was busy. She
 promptly flew into a rage, and said to the servant: Go and tell your master
 that he will not trouble me for long. On the very next day he was taken ill,
 and he was buried within a week.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there are witches who can bewitch their judges by a mere look or glance
 from their eyes, and publicly boast that they cannot be punished; and when
 malefactors have been imprisoned for their crimes, and exposed to the
 severest torture to make them tell the truth, these witches can endow them
 with such an obstinacy of preserving silence that they are unable to lay
 bare their crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there are some who, in order to accomplish their evil charms and spells,
 beat and stab the Crucifix, and utter the filthiest words against the Purity
 of the Most Glorious Virgin MARY, casting the foulest aspersions on the
 Nativity of Our Saviour from Her inviolate womb. It is not expedient to
 repeat those vile words, nor yet to describe their detestable crimes, as the
 narrative would give too great offence to the ears of the pious; but they
 are all kept and preserved in writing, detailing the manner in which a
 certain baptized Jewess had instructed other young girls. And one of them,
 named Walpurgis, being in the same year at the point of death, and being
 urged by those who stood round her to confess her sins, exclaimed: I have
 given myself body and soul to the devil; there is no hope of forgiveness for
 me; and so died.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 These particulars have not been written to the shame, but rather to the
 praise and glory of the most illustrious Archduke. For he was truly a
 Catholic Prince, and laboured very zealously with the Church at Brixen to
 exterminate witches. But they are written rather in hate and loathing of so
 great a crime, and that men may not cease to avenge their wrongs, and the
 insults and offences these wretches offer to the Creator and our Holy Faith,
 to say nothing of the temporal losses which they cause. For this is their
 greatest and gravest crime, namely, that they abjure the Faith.

<h2>Chapter XIII</h2>
<h3>How Witch Midwives commit most Horrid Crimes when they either Kill Children or Offer them to Devils in most Accursed Wise.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We must not omit to mention the injuries done to children by witch midwives,
 first by killing them, and secondly by blasphemously offering them to devils.
 In the diocese of Strasburg and in the town of Zabern there is an honest
 woman very devoted to the Blessed Virgin MARY, who tells the following
 experience of hers to all the guests that come to the tavern which she
 keeps, known by the sign of the Black Eagle.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I was, she says, pregnant by my lawful husband, now dead, and as my time
 approached, a certain midwife importuned me to engage her to assist at the
 birth of my child. But I knew her bad reputation, and although I had
 decided to engage another woman, pretended with conciliatory words to agree
 to her request. But when the pains came upon me, and I had brought in another
 midwife, the first one was very angry, and hardly a week later came into my
 room one night with two other women, and approached the bed where I was
 lying. And when I tried to call my husband, who was sleeping in another room,
 all the use was taken away from my limbs and tongue, so that except for
 seeing and hearing I could not move a muscle. And the witch, standing
 between the other two, said: “See! this vile woman, who would not take
 me for her midwife, shall not win through unpunished.” The other two
 standing be her pleaded for me, saying: “She has never harmed any of
 us.” But the witch added: “Because she has offended me I am
 going to put something into her entrails; but, to please you, she shall not
 feel any pain for half a year, but after that time she shall be tortured
 enough.” So she came up and touched my belly with her hands; and it
 seemed to me that she took out my entrails, and put in something which,
 however, I could not see. And when they had gone away, and I had recovered
 my power of speech, I called my husband as soon as possible, and told him
 what had happened. But he put it down to pregnancy, and said: “You
 pregnant women are always suffering from fancies and delusions.” And
 when he would by no means believe me, I replied: “I have been given
 six months' grace, and if, after that time, no torment comes to me, I shall
 believe you.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 She related this to her son, a cleric who was then Archdeacon of the district,
 and who came to visit her on the same day. And what happened? When exactly
 six months had passed, such a terrible pain came into her belly that she
 could not help disturbing everybody with her cries day and night. And
 because, as has been said, she was most devout to the Virgin, the Queen of
 Mercy, she fasted with bread and water every Saturday, so that she believed
 that she was delivered by Her intercession. For one day, when she wanted to
 perform an action of nature, all those unclean things fell from her body;
 and she called her husband and son, and said: “Are those fancies? Did
 I not say that after a half a year the truth would be known? Or who ever saw
 me ear thorns, bones, and even bits of wood?” For there were brambles
 as long as a palm, as well as a quantity of other things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Moreover (as was said in the First Part of the work), it was shown by the
 confession of the servant, who was brought to judgement at Breisach, that
 the greatest injuries to the Faith as regards the heresy of witches are done
 by midwives; and this is made clearer than daylight itself by the confessions
 of some who were afterwards burned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For in the diocese of Basel at the town of Dann, a witch who was burned
 confessed that she had killed more than forty children, by sticking a
 needle through the crowns of their heads into their brains, as they came out
 from the womb.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Finally, another woman in the diocese of Strasburg confessed that she had
 killed more children than she could count. And she was caught in this way.
 She had been called from one town to another to act as midwife to a certain
 woman, and, having performed her office, was going back home. But as she
 went out of the town gate, the arm of a newly born child fell out of the
 cloak she had wrapped around her, in whose folds the arm had been concealed.
 This was seen by those who were sitting in the gateway, and when she had
 gone on, they picked up from the ground what they took to be a piece of
 meat; but when they looked more closely and saw that it was not a piece of
 meat, but recognized it by its fingers as a child's arm, they reported it
 to the magistrates, and it was found that a child had died before baptism,
 lacking an arm. So the witch was taken and questioned, and confessed the
 crime, and that she had, as has been said, killed more children than she
 could count.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the reason for such practices is as follows: It is to be presumed that
 witches are compelled to do such things at the command of evil spirits, and
 sometimes against their own wills. For the devil knows that, because of the
 pain of loss, or original sin, such children are
 debarred from entering the Kingdom of Heaven. And by this means the Last
 Judgement is delayed, when the devils will be condemned to eternal torture;
 since the number of the elect os more slowly completed, on the fulfilment of
 which the world will be consumed. And also, as has already been shown,
 witches are taught by the devil to confect from the limbs of such children
 an unguent which is very useful for their spells.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But in order to bring so great a sin into utter detestation, we must not
 pass over in silence the following horrible crime. For when they do not kill
 the child, they blasphemously offer it to the devil in this manner. As soon
 as the child is born, the midwife, if the mother herself is not a witch,
 carries it out of the room on the pretext of warming it, raises it up, and
 offers it to the Prince of Devils, that is Lucifer, and to all the devils.
 And this is done by the kitchen fire.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A certain man relates that he noticed that his wife, when her time came to
 give birth, against the usual custom of women in childbirth, did not allow
 any woman to approach the bed except her own daughter, who acted as midwife.
 Wishing to know the reason for this, he hid himself in the house and saw the
 whole order of the sacrilege and dedication to the devil, as it has been
 described. He saw also, as it seemed to him, that without any human support,
 but by the power of the devil, the child was climbing up the chain by which
 the cooking-pots were suspended. In great consternation both at the terrible
 words of the invocation of the devils, and at the other iniquitous ceremonies,
 he strongly insisted that the child should be baptized immediately. While it
 was being carried to the next village, where there was a church, and when
 they had to cross a bridge over a certain river, he drew his sword and ran
 at his daughter, who was carrying the child, saying in the hearing of two
 others who were with them: “You shall not carry the child over the
 bridge; for either it must cross the bridge by itself, or you shall be
 drowned in the river.” The daughter was terrified and, together with
 the other women in company, asked him if he were in his right mind (for he
 had hidden what had happened from all the others except the two men who were
 with him). Then he answered: “You vile drab, by your magic arts you
 made the child climb the chain in the kitchen; now make it cross the bridge
 with no on carrying it, or I shall drown you in the river.” And so,
 being compelled, she put the child down on the bridge, and invoked the devil
 by her art; and suddenly the child was seen on the other side of the bridge.
 And when the child had been baptized, and he had returned home, since he now
 had witnesses to convict his daughter of witchcraft (for he could not prove
 the former crime of the oblation to the devil, inasmuch as he had been the
 only witness of the sacrilegious ritual), he accused bother daughter and
 mother before the judge after their period of purgation; and they were both
 burned, and the crime of midwives of making that sacrilegious offering was
 discovered.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But here the doubt arises: to what end or purpose is the sacrilegious
 offering of children, and how does it benefit the devils? To this it can be
 said that the devils do this for three reasons, which serve three most
 wicked purposes. The first reason arises from their pride, which always
 increases; as it is said: “They that hate Thee have lifted up the
 head.” For they try as far as possible
 to conform with divine rites and ceremonies. Secondly, they can more easily
 deceive men under the mask of an outwardly seeming pious action. For in the
 same way they entice young virgins and boys into their power; for though
 they might solicit such by means of evil and corrupt men, yet they rather
 deceive them by magic mirrors and reflections seen in witches' finger-nails,
 and lure them on in the belief that they love chastity, whereas they hate
 it. For the devil hates above all the Blessed Virgin, because she
 bruised his head. Just so in this oblation
 of children they deceive the minds of witches into the vice of infidelity
 under the appearance of a virtuous acts. And the third reason is, that the
 perfidy of witches may grow, to the devils' own gain, when they have
 witches dedicated to them from their very cradles.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this sacrilege affects the child in three ways. In the first place,
 visible offerings to God are made of visible things, such as wine of bread
 or the fruits of the earth, as a sign of honour and subjection to Him, as it
 is said in <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxv: Thou shalt not appear empty before
 the Lord. And such offerings cannot and must not afterwards be put to
 profane uses. Therefore the holy Father, S. John Damascene, says: The
 oblations which are offered in church belong only to the priests, but not
 that they should divert them to their own uses, but that they should
 faithfully distribute them, partly in the observance of divine worship, and
 partly for the use of the poor. From this it follows that a child who has
 been offered to the devil in sign of subjection and homage to him cannot
 possibly be dedicated by Catholics to a holy life, in worthy and fruitful
 service to God for the benefit of himself and others.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For who can say that the sins of the mothers and of other do not redound in
 punishment upon the children? Perhaps someone will quote that saying of the
 prophet: “The sons shall not bear the iniquity of the father.”
 But there is that other passage in <i>Exodus</i> xx: I am a jealous God,
 visiting the sins of the father upon the children unto the third and fourth
 generation. Now the meaning of these two sayings is as follows. The first
 speaks of spiritual punishment in the judgement of Heaven or God, and not in
 the judgement of men. And this is the punishment of the soul, such as loss
 or the forfeiture of glory, or the punishment of pain, that is, of the
 torment of eternal fire. And with such punishments no one is punished except
 for his own sin, either inherited as original sin or committed as actual
 sin.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second text speaks of those who imitate the sins of their father, as
 Gratian has explained (I, q. 4, etc.); and
 there he gives other explanations as to how the judgement of God inflicts
 other punishments on a man, not only for his own sins which he has committed,
 or which he might commit (but is prevented by punishment from committing),
 but also for the sins of others.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it cannot be argued that when a man is punished without cause, and
 without sin, which should be the cause of punishment. For according to the
 rule of law, no one must be punished without sin, unless there is some cause
 of punishment. And we can say that there is always a most just cause, though
 it may not be known to us: see S. Augustine, XXIV, 4. And if we cannot in
 the result penetrate the depth of God's judgement, yet we know that what He
 has said is true, and what He has done is just.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there is this distinction to be observed in innocent children who are
 offered to devils not by their mothers when they are witches, but by
 midwives who, as we have said, secretly take from the embrace and the womb
 of an honest mother. Such children are not so cut off from grace that they
 must necessarily become prone to such crimes; but it is piously to be
 believed that they may rather cultivate their mothers' virtues.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second result to the children of this sacrilege is as follows. When a
 man offers himself as a sacrifice to God, he recognizes God as his Beginning
 and his End; and this sacrifice is more worthy than all the external
 sacrifices which he makes, having its beginning in his creation and its end
 in his glorification, as it is said: A sacrifice to God is an afflicted
 spirit, etc. In the same way, when a witch
 offers a child to the devils, she commends it body and soul to him as its
 beginning and its end in eternal damnation; wherefore not without some
 miracle can the child be set free from the payment of so great a debt.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we read often in history of children whom their mothers, in some passion
 or mental disturbance, have unthinkingly offered to the devil from the very
 womb, and how it is only with the very greatest difficulty that they can,
 when they have grown to adult age, be delivered from that bondage which the
 devil has, with God's permission, usurped to himself. And of this the
 <i>Book of Examples, Most Blessed Virgin MARY</i>, affords many illustrations;
 a notable instance being that of the man whom the Supreme Pontiff was unable
 to deliver from the torments of the devil, but at last he was sent to a holy
 man living in the East, and finally with great difficulty was delivered from
 his bondage through the intercession of the Most Glorious Virgin Herself.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if God so severely punishes even such a thoughtless, I will not say
 sacrifice, but commendation used angrily by a mother when her husband, after
 copulating with her, says, I hope a child will come of it; and she answers,
 May the child go to the devil! How much greater must be the punishment when
 the Divine Majesty is offended in the way we have described!

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter XIV</h2>
<h3>Here followeth how Witches Injure Cattle in Various Ways.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 When S. Paul said, Doth God care for oxen? he
 meant that, though all things are subject to Divine providence, both man and
 beast each in its degree, as the Psalmist
 says, yet the sons of men are especially in His governance and under the
 protection of His wings. I say, therefore, if men are injured by witches,
 with God's permission, both the innocent and just as well as sinners, and if
 parents are bewitched in their children, as being part of their possessions,
 who can then presume to doubt that, with God's permission, various injuries
 can be brought by witches upon cattle and the fruits of the earth, which are
 also part of men's possessions? For so was Job stricken by the devil and
 lost all his cattle. So also there is not even the smallest farm where
 women do not injure each other's cows, by drying up their milk, and very
 often killing them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But first let us consider the smallest of these injuries, that of drying up
 the milk. If it is asked how they can do this, it can be answered that,
 according to Blessed Albert in his <i>Book on Animals</i>, milk is naturally
 menstrual in any animal; and, like another flux in women, when it is not
 stopped by some natural infirmity, it is due to witchcraft that it is
 stopped. Now the flow of milk is naturally stopped when the animal becomes
 pregnant; and it is stopped by an accidental infirmity when the animal eats
 some herb the nature of which is to dry up the milk and make the cow ill.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But they can cause this in various ways by witchcraft. For on the more holy
 nights according to the instructions of the devil and for the greater
 offence to the Divine Majesty of God, a witch will sit down in a corner of
 her house with a pail between her legs, stick a knife or some instrument in
 the wall or a post, and make as if to milk it with her hands. Then she
 summons her familiar who always works with her in everything, and tells him
 that she wishes to milk a certain cow from a certain house, which is healthy
 and abounding in milk. And suddenly the devil takes the milk from the udder
 of that cow, and brings it to where the witch is sitting, as if it were
 flowing from the knife.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But when this is publicly preached to the people they get no bad information
 by it; for however much anyone may invoke the devil, and think that by this
 alone he can do this thing, he deceives himself, because he is without the
 foundation of that perfidy, not having rendered homage to the devil or
 abjured the Faith. I have set this down because some have thought that
 several of the matter of which I have written ought not to be preacher to
 the people, on account of the danger of giving them evil knowledge; whereas
 it is impossible for anyone to learn from a preacher how to perform any of
 the things that have been mentioned. But they have been written rather to
 bring so great a crime into detestation, and should be preached from the
 pulpit, so that judges may be more eager to punish the horrible crime of the
 abnegation of the Faith. Yet they should not always be preached in this way;
 for the secular mind pays more attention to temporal losses, being more
 concerned with earthly than spiritual matters; therefore when witches can be
 accused of inflicting temporal loss, judges are more zealous to punish them.
 But who can fathom the cunning of the devil?<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I know of some men in a certain city who wished to eat some May butter one
 May time. And as they were walking along they came to a meadow and say down
 by a stream; and one of them, who had formed some open or tacit pact with
 the devil, said: I will get you the best May butter. And at once he took off
 his clothes and went into the stream, not standing up but sitting with his
 back against the current; and while the others looked on, he uttered certain
 words, and moved the water with his hands behind his back; and in a short
 time he brought out a great quantity of butter of the sort that the country
 women sell in the market in May. And the others tasted it and declared that
 it was the very best butter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this we can deduce first the following fact concerning their practices.
 They are either true witches, by reason of an expressed pact formed with the
 devil, or they know by some tacit understanding that the devil will do what
 they ask. In the first case there is no need for any discussion, for such
 are true witches. But in the second case, then they owed the devil's help to
 the fact that they were blasphemously offered to the devil by a midwife or
 by their own mothers.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be objected that the devil perhaps brought the butter without any
 compact, expressed or tacit, and without any previous dedication to himself.
 It is answered that no one can ever use the devil's help in such matters
 without invoking him; and that by that very act of seeking help from the
 devil he is an apostate from the Faith. This is the decision of S. Thomas in
 the <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>, dist. 8, on the question, Whether it is
 apostasy from the Faith to use the devil's help. And although Blessed Albert
 the Great agrees with the other Doctors, yet he says more expressly that in
 such matters there is always apostasy either in word or in deed. For if
 invocations, conjurations, fumigations and adorations are used, then an open
 pact is formed with the devil, even if there has been no surrender of body
 and soul together with explicit abjuration of the Faith either wholly or in
 part. For by the mere invocation of the devil a man commits open verbal
 apostasy. But if there is no spoken invocation, but only a bare action from
 which follows something that could not be done without the devil's help,
 then whether a man does it be beginning in the name of the devil, or with
 some other unknown words, or without any words but with that intention; then,
 says Blessed Albert, it is apostasy of deed, because that action is looked
 for from the devil. But since to expect or receive anything from the devil
 is always a disparagement of the Faith, it is also apostasy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 So it is concluded that, by whatever means that sorcerer procured the butter,
 it was done with either a tacit or an expressed pact with the devil; and
 since, if it had been with an expressed pact, he would have behaved after
 the usual manner of witches, it is probably that there was a tacit or secret
 pact, originating either from himself or from his mother or a midwife. And I
 say that it arose from himself, since he only went through certain motions,
 and expected the devil to produce the effect.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second conclusion we can draw from this and similar practices is this.
 The devil cannot create new species of things; therefore when natural butter
 suddenly came out of the water, the devil did not do this by changing the
 water into milk, but by taking butter from some place where it was kept and
 bringing it to the man's hand. Or else he took natural milk from a natural
 cow and suddenly churned it into natural butter; for while the art of women
 takes a little time to make butter, the devil could do it in the shortest
 space of time and bring it to the man.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is in the same way that certain dealers in magic, when they find
 themselves in need of wine or some such necessity, merely go out in the
 night with a flask or vessel, and bring it back suddenly filled with wine.
 For then the devil takes natural wine from some vessel and fills their
 flasks for them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And with regard to the manner whereby witches kill animals and cattle, it
 should be said that they act very much as they do in the case of men. They
 can bewitch them by a touch and a look, or by a look only; or by placing
 under the threshold of the stable door, or near the place where they go to
 water, some charm or periapt of witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For in this way those witches who were burned at Ratisbon, of whom we shall
 say more later on, were always incited by the devil to bewitch the best
 horses and the fattest cattle. And when they were asked how they did so, one
 of them named Agnes said that they hid certain things under the threshold of
 the stable door. And, asked what sort of things, she said: The bones of
 different kinds of animals. She was further asked in whose name they did
 this, and answered, In the name of the devil and all the other devils. And
 there was another of them, named Anna, who had killed twenty-three horses in
 succession belonging to one of the citizens who was a carrier. This man at
 last, when he had bought his twenty-fourth horse and reduced to extreme
 poverty, stood in his stable and said to the witch, who was standing in the
 door of her house: “See, I have bought a horse, and I swear to God and
 His Holy Mother that if this horse dies I shall kill you with my own hands.”
 At that the witch was frightened, and left the horse alone. But when she was
 taken and asked how she had done these things, she answered that she had done
 nothing but dig a little hole, after which the devil had put in it certain
 things unknown to her. From this it is concluded that the witch co-operates
 sufficiently if it is only by a touch or a look; for the devil is permitted
 no power of injuring creatures without some co-operation on the part of the
 witch, as has been shown before. And this is for the great offence to the
 Divine Majesty.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For shepherds have often seen animals in the fields give three or four jumps
 into the air, and then suddenly fall to the ground and die; and this is
 caused by the power of witches at the instance of the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the diocese of Strasburg, between the town of Fiessen and Mount Ferrer,
 a certain very rich man affirmed that more than forty oxen and cows belonging
 to him and others had been bewitched in the Alps within the space of one
 year, and that there had been no natural plague or sickness to cause it. To
 prove this, he said that when cattle die from some change plague or disease,
 they do not do so all at once, but by degrees; but that this witchcraft had
 suddenly taken all the strength from them, and therefore everyone judged
 that they had been killed by witchcraft. I have said forty head of cattle,
 but I believe he put the number higher than that. However, it is very true
 that many cattle are said to have been bewitched in some districts,
 especially in the Alps; and it is known that this form of witchcraft if
 unhappily most widespread. We shall consider some similar cases later, in
 the chapter where we discuss the remedies for cattle that have been
 bewitched.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter XV</h2>
<h3>How they Raise and Stir up Hailstorms and Tempests, and Cause Lightning to Blast both Men and Beasts.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 That devils and their disciples can by witchcraft cause lightnings and
 hailstorms and tempests, and that the devils have power from God to do this,
 and their disciples do so with God's permission, is proved by Holy Scripture
 in <i>Job</i> i and ii. For the devil received power from God, and
 immediately caused it to happen that the Sabeans took away from Job fifty
 yoke of oxen and five hundred asses, and then fire came from heaven and
 consumed seven thousand camels, and a great wind came and smote down this
 house, killing his seven sons and his three daughters, and all the young
 men, that is to say, the servants, except him who brought the news, were
 killed; and finally the devil smote the body of the holy man with the most
 terrible sores, and caused his wife and his three friends to vex him
 grievously.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 S. Thomas in his commentary on Job says as follows: It must be confessed
 that, with God's permission, the devils can disturb the air, raise up winds,
 and make the fire fall from heaven. For although, in the matter of taking
 various shapes, corporeal nature is not at the command of any Angel, either
 good or bad, but only at that of God the Creator, yet in the matter of local
 motion corporeal nature has to obey the spiritual nature. And this truth is
 clearly exemplified in man himself; for at the mere command of the will,
 which exists subjectively in the soul, the limbs are moved to perform that
 which they have been willed to do. Therefore whatever can be accomplished
 by mere local motion, this not only good but bad spirits can by their
 natural power accomplish, unless God should forbid it. But winds and rain
 and other similar disturbances of the air can be caused by the mere movement
 of vapours released from the earth or the water; therefore the natural
 power of devils is sufficient to cause such things. So says S. Thomas.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For God in His justice using the devils as his agents of punishment inflicts
 the evils which come to us who live in this world. Therefore, with reference
 to that in the Psalms: “He called a famine on the land, and wasted all
 their substance of bread.”; the gloss says: God allowed this evil to
 be caused by the bad Angels who are in charge of such matters; and by famine
 is meant the Angel in charge of famine.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We refer the reader also to what has been written above on the question as
 to whether witches must always have the devil's help to aid them in their
 works, and concerning the three kinds of harm which the devils at times
 inflict without the agency of a witch. But the devils are more eager to
 injure men with the help of a witch, since in this way God is the more
 offended, and greater power is given to them to torment and punish.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And relevant to this subject is what the Doctors have written in the
 <i>Second book of Sentences</i>, dist. 6, on the question whether there is
 a special place assigned to the bad Angels in the clouds of the air. For in
 devils there are three things to be considered - their nature, their duty
 and their sin; and by nature they belong to the empyrean of heaven, through
 sin to the lower hell, but by reason of the duty assigned to them, as we
 have said, as ministers of punishment to the wicked and trial to the good,
 their place is in the clouds of the air. For they do not dwell here with us
 on the earth lest they should plague us too much; but in the air and around
 the fiery sphere they can so bring together the active and passive agents
 that, when God permits, they can bring down fire and lightning from heaven.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A story is told in the <i>Formicarius</i> of
 a certain man who had been taken, and was asked by the judge how they went
 about to raise up hailstorms and tempests, and whether it was easy for them
 to do so. He answered: We can easily cause hailstorms, but we cannot do all
 the harm that we wish, because of the guardianship of good Angels. And he
 added: We can only injure those who are deprived of God's help; but we
 cannot hurt those who make the sign of the Cross. And this is how we got to
 work: first we use certain words in the fields to implore the chief of the
 devils to send one of his servants to strike the man whom we name. Then,
 when the devil has come, we sacrifice to him a black cock at two
 cross-roads, throwing it up into the air; and
 when the devil has received this, he performs our wish and stirs up the air,
 but not always in the places which we have named, and, according to the
 permission of the living God, sends down hailstorms and lightnings.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the same work we hear of a certain leader or heresiarch of witches named
 Staufer, who lived in Berne and the adjacent
 country, and used publicly to boast that, whenever he liked, he could change
 himself into a mouse in the sight of his rivals and slip through the hands
 of his deadly enemies; and that he had often escaped from the hands of his
 mortal foes in this manner. But when the Divine justice wished to put an end
 to his wickedness, some of his enemies lay in wait for him cautiously and
 saw him sitting in a basket near a window, and suddenly pierced him through
 with swords and spears, so that he miserably died for his crimes. Yet he
 left behind him a disciple, named Hoppo, who had also for his master that
 Stadlin whom we have mentioned before in the sixth chapter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 These two could, whenever they pleased, cause the third part of the manure
 or straw or corn to pass invisibly from a neighbour's field to their own;
 they could raise the most violent hailstorms and destructive winds and
 lightning; could cast into the water in the sight of their parents children
 walking by the water-side, when there was no one else in sight; could cause
 barrenness in men and animals; could reveal hidden things to others; could
 in many ways injure men in their affairs or their bodies; could at times
 kill whom they would by lightning; and could cause many other plagues, when
 and where the justice of God permitted such things to be done.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is better to add an instance which came within our own experience. For in
 the diocese of Constance, twenty-eight German miles from the town of
 Ratisbon in the direction of Salzburg, a violent hailstorm destroyed all the
 fruit, crops and vineyards in a belt one mile wide, so that the vines hardly
 bore fruit for three years. This was brought to the notice of the
 Inquisition, since the people clamoured for an inquiry to be held; many
 beside all the townsmen being of the opinion that it was caused by
 witchcraft. Accordingly it was agreed after fifteen days' formal
 deliberation that it was a case of witchcraft for us to consider; and among
 a large number of suspects, we particularly examined two women, one named
 Agnes, a bath-woman, and the other Anna von Mindelheim. These two were taken
 and shut up separately in different prisons, neither of them knowing in the
 least what had happened to the other. On the following day the bath-woman
 was very gently questioned in the presence of a notary by the chief
 magistrate, a justice named Gelre very zealous for the Faith, and by the
 other magistrates with him; and although she was undoubtedly well provided
 with that evil gift of silence which is the constant bane of judges, and at
 the first trial affirmed that she was innocent of any crime against man or
 woman; yet, in the Divine mercy that so great a crime should not pass
 unpunished, suddenly, when she had been freed from her chains, although it
 was in the torture chamber, she fully laid bare all the crimes which she
 had committed. For when she was questioned by the Notary of the Inquisition
 upon the accusations which had been brought against her of harm done to men
 and cattle, by reason of which she had been gravely suspected of being a
 witch, although there had been no witness to prove that she had abjured the
 Faith or performed coitus with an Incubus devil (for she had been most
 secret); nevertheless, after she had confessed to the harm which she had
 caused to animals and men, she acknowledged also all that she was asked
 concerning the abjuration of the Faith, and copulation committed with an
 Incubus devil; saying that for more than eighteen years she had given her
 body to an Incubus devil, with a complete abnegation of the Faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 After this she was asked whether she knew anything about the hailstorm which
 we have mentioned, and answered that she did. And, being asked how and in
 what way, she answered: “I was in my house, and at midday a familiar
 came to me and told me to go with a little water on to the field or plain of
 Kuppel (for so is it named). And when I asked what he wanted to do with the
 water, he said that he wanted to make it rain. So I went out at the town
 gate, and found the devil standing under a tree.” The judge asked her,
 under which tree; and she said, “Under that one opposite that tower,”
 pointing it out. Asked what she did under the tree, she said, “The
 devil told me to dig a hole and pour the water into it.” Asked whether
 they say down together, she said, “I sat down, but the devil stood
 up.” Then she was, with what words and in what manner she had stirred
 the water; and she answered, “I stirred it with my finger, and called
 on the name of the devil himself and all the other devils.” Again the
 judge asked what was done with the water, and she answered: “It
 disappeared, and the devil took it up into the air.” Then she was
 asked if she had any associate, and answered: “Under another tree
 opposite I had a companion (naming the other capture witch, Anna von
 Mindelheim), but I do not know what she did.” Finally, the bath-woman
 was asked how long it was between the taking up of the water the hailstorm;
 and she answered: “There was just sufficient interval of time to allow
 me to get back to my house.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But (and this is remarkable) when on the next day the other witch had at
 first been exposed to the very gentlest questions, being suspended hardly
 clear of the ground by her thumbs, after she had been set quite free, she
 disclosed the whole matter without the slightest discrepancy from what the
 other had told; agreeing as to the place, that it was under such a tree and
 the other had been under another; as to the method, namely, of stirring
 water poured into a hole in the name of the devil and all the devils; and as
 to the interval of time, that the hailstorm had come after her devil had
 taken the water up into the air and she had returned home. Accordingly, on
 the third day they were burned. And the bath-woman was contrite and
 confessed, and commended herself to God, saying that she would die with a
 willing heart if she could escape the tortures of the devil, and held in her
 hand a cross which she kissed. But the other witch scorned her for doing so.
 And this one had consorted with an Incubus devil for more than twenty years
 with a complete abjuration of the Faith, and had done far more harm than the
 former witch to men, cattle and the fruits of the earth, as is shown in the
 preserved record of their trial.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 These instances must serve, since indeed countless examples of this sort
 of mischief could be recounted. But very often men and beasts and
 storehouses are struck by lightning by the power of devils; and the cause of
 this seems to be more hidden and ambiguous, since it often appears to happen
 by Divine permission without the co-operation of any witch. However, it has
 been found that witches have freely confessed that they have done such things,
 and there are various instances of it, which could be mentioned, in addition
 to what has already been said. Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that,
 just as easily as they raise hailstorms, so can they cause lightning and
 storms at sea; and so no doubt at all remains on these points.

<h2>Chapter XVI</h2>
<h3>Of Three Ways in which Men and Women may be Discovered to be Addicted to Witchcraft: Divided into Three Heads: and First of the Witchcraft of Archers.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For our present purpose the last class of witchcraft is that which is
 practised in three forms by men; and first we must consider the seven deadly
 and horrible crimes which are committed by wizards who are archers. For
 first, on the Sacred Day of the Passion of Our Lord, that is to say, on Good
 Friday, as it is called, during the solemnization of the Mass of the
 Presanctified they shoot with arrows, as at a target, at the most sacred
 image of the Crucifix. Oh, the cruelty and injury to the Saviour! Secondly,
 though there is some doubt whether they have to utter a verbal form of
 apostasy to the devil in addition to that apostasy of deed, yet whether it
 be so or not, no greater injury to the Faith can be done by a Christian. For
 it is certain that, if such things were done by an infidel, they would be of
 no efficacy; for no such easy method of gratifying their hostility to the
 Faith is granted to them. Therefore these wretches ought to consider the
 truth and power of the Catholic Faith, for the confirmation of which God
 justly permits such crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, such an archer has to shoot three or four arrows in this way, and
 as a consequence he is able to kill on any day just the same number of men.
 Fourthly, they have the following assurance from the devil; that though
 they must first actually set eyes on the man they wish to kill, and must
 bend their whole will on killing him, yet it matter not where the man may
 shut himself up, for he cannot be protected, but the arrows which have been
 shot will be carried and struck into him by the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fifthly, they can shoot an arrow with such
 precision as to shoot a penny from a person's head without hurting his head,
 and they can continue to do this indefinitely. Sixthly, in order to gain
 this power they have to offer homage of body and soul to the devil. We shall
 give some instances of this sort of practice.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For a certain prince of the Rhineland, named Eberhard Longbeard because he
 let his beard grow, had, before he was sixty years old, acquired for himself
 some of the Imperial territory, and was besieging a certain castle named
 Lendenbrunnen because of the raids which were made by the men of the castle.
 And he had in his company a wizard of this sort, named Puncker, who so
 molested the men of the castle that he killed them all in succession with
 his arrows, except one. And this is how he proceeded. Whenever he had looked
 at a man, it did not matter where that man went to or hid himself, he had
 only to loose an arrow and that man was mortally wounded and killed; and he
 was able to shoot three such arrows every day because he had shot three
 arrows at the image of the Saviour. It is probable that the devil favours
 the number three more than any other, because it represents an effective
 denial of the Holy Trinity. But after he had shot those three arrows, he
 could only shoot with the same uncertainty as other men. At last one of the
 men of the castle called out to him mockingly, “Puncker, will you not
 at least spare the ring which hangs in the gate?” And he answered from
 outside in the night, “No; I shall take it away on the day that the
 castle is captured.” And he fulfilled his promise: for when, as has
 been said, all were killed except one, and the castle had been taken, he
 took that ring and hung it in his own house at Rorbach in the diocese of
 Worms, where it can be seen hanging to this day. But afterwards he was one
 night killed with their spades by some peasants whom he had injured, and he
 perished in his sins.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is told also of this man, that a very eminent person wished to have
 proof of his skill, and for a test placed his little son before the target
 with a penny on his cap, and ordered him to shoot the penny away without
 removing the cap. The wizard said that he would do it, but with reluctance,
 not being sure whether the devil was seducing him to his death. But,
 yielding to the persuasions of the prince, he placed one arrow in readiness
 in the cord which was slung over his should, fitted another to his bow, and
 shot the penny from the cap without hurting the boy. Seeing this, the prince
 asked him why he had placed the arrow in that cord; and he answered: “If
 I had been deceived by the devil and had killed my son, since I should have
 had to die I would quickly have shot you with the other arrow to avenge my
 death.”<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And though such wickedness is permitted by God for the proving and
 chastisement of the faithful, nevertheless more powerful miracles are
 performed by the Saviour's mercy for the strengthening and glory of the
 Faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For in the diocese of Constance, near the castle of Hohenzorn and a convent
 of nuns, there is a newly-built church where may be seen an image of Our
 Saviour pierced with an arrow and bleeding. And the truth of this miracle
 is shown as follows. A miserable wretch who wished to be assured by the
 devil of having three or four arrows with which he could, in the manner we
 have told, kill whom he pleased, shot and pierced with an arrow (just as it
 is still seen) a certain Crucifix at a crossroad; and when it miraculously
 began to bleed, the wretch was stuck motionless
 in his steps by Divine power. And when he was asked by a passer-by why he
 stood fixed there, he shook his head, and trembling in his arms and his
 hands, in which he held the bow, and all over his body, could answer nothing.
 So the other looked about him, and saw the Crucifix with the arrow and the
 blood, and said: “You villain, you have pierced the image of Our
 Lord!” And calling some others, he told them to see that he did not
 escape (although, as has been said, he could not move), and ran to the
 castle and told what had happened. And they came down and found the wretched
 man in the same place; and when they had questioned him, and he had
 confessed his crime, he was removed from that district by public justice,
 and suffered a miserable death in merited expiation of his deeds.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But, alas! how horrible it is to think that human perversity is not afraid
 to countenance such crimes. For it is said that in the halls of the great
 such men are maintained to glory in their crimes in open contempt of the
 Faith, to the heavy offence of the Divine Majesty, and in scorn of Our
 Redeemer; and are permitted to boast of their deeds.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore such protectors, defenders and patrons are to be judged not only
 heretics, but even apostates from the Faith, and are to be punished in the
 manner that will be told. And this is the seventh deadly sin of these
 wizards. For first they are by very law excommunicated; and if the patrons
 are clerics they are degraded and deprived of all office and benefit, nor
 can they be restored except by a special indulgence from the Apostolic See.
 Also, if after their proscription such protectors remain obstinate in their
 excommunication for the period of a year, they are to be condemned as
 heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This is in accordance with the Canon Law; for, in Book VI, it touches on the
 question of direct or indirect interference with the proceedings of
 Diocesans and Inquisitors in the cause of the Faith, and mentions the
 aforesaid punishment to be inflicted after a year. For it say: We forbid
 any interference from Potentates, temporal Lords and Rulers, and their
 Officials, etc. Anyone may refer to the chapter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And further, that witches and their protectors are by very law to be
 excommunicated is shown in the Canon of the suppressing of the heresy of
 witchcraft; especially where it says: We excommunicate and anathematize all
 heretics, Catharists, Sectaries . . . and others, by whatever names they
 are known, etc. And with these it includes all their sympathizers and
 protectors, and others; saying later on: Also we excommunicate all followers,
 protectors, defenders and patrons of such heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The Canon Law prescribes various penalties which are incurred within the
 space of a year by such heretics, whether laymen or clerics, where it says:
 We place under the ban of excommunication all their protectors, patrons and
 defenders, so that when any such has been so sentenced and has scorned to
 recant his heresy, within a year from that time he shall be considered an
 outlaw, and shall not be admitted to any office or council, nor be able to
 vote in the election of such officers, nor be allowed free opportunity of
 giving evidence; he shall not succeed to any inheritance, and no one shall
 be held responsible for any business transaction with him. If he be a judge,
 his judgement shall not stand, nor shall any case be brought to his hearing.
 If he be an advocate, he shall not be allowed to plead. If he be a notary,
 no instrument drawn up by him shall have any weight, but is to be condemned
 together with its condemned author; and similar penalties are decreed for
 the holders of other offices. But if he be a cleric, he is to be degraded
 from all office and benefice; for, his guilt being the greater, it is more
 heavily avenged. And if any such, after they have been marked down by the
 Church, contemptuously try to ignore their punishment, the sentence of
 excommunication is to be rigorously applied to them to the extreme limits of
 vengeance. And the clergy shall not administer the Sacraments of the Church
 to such heretics, nor presume to give them Christian burial, nor accept
 their alms and oblations, on pain of being deprived of their office, to
 which they can in no way be restored without a special indulgence from the
 Apostolic See.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There are, finally, many other penalties incurred by such heretics even when
 they do not persist in their obstinacy for a year, and also by their
 children and grandchildren: for they can be degraded by a Bishop or by an
 Inquisitor, declared deprived of all titles, possessions, honours and
 ecclesiastical benefits, in fine of all public offices whatsoever. But this
 is only when they are persistently and obstinately impenitent. Also their
 sons to the second generation may be disqualified and unable to obtain
 either ecclesiastical preferment or public office; but this is to be
 understood only of the descendants on the father's side, and not on the
 mother's, and only of those who are impenitent. Also all their followers,
 protectors, fautors and patrons shall be denied all right of petition or
 appeal; and this is explained as meaning that, after a verdict has been
 returned that they are such heretics, then can they make no appeal before
 their sentence, however much they may have been in any respect ill-used or
 treated with undue severity. Much more could be adduced in support of our
 standpoint, but this is sufficient.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now for the better understanding of what has been said, some few points are
 to be discussed. And first, if a prince or secular potentate employ such
 a wizard as we have described for the destruction of some castle in a just
 war, and with his help crushes the tyranny of wicked men; is his whole army
 to be considered as protectors and patrons of that wizard, and to be
 subjected to the penalties we have mentioned? The answer seems to be that
 the rigour of justice must be tempered on account of their numbers. For the
 leader, with his counsellors and advisers, must be considered to have aided
 and abetted such witchcraft, and they are by law implicated in the aforesaid
 penalties when, after being warned by their spiritual advisers, they have
 persisted in their bad course; and then they are to be judged protectors
 and patrons, and are to be punished. But the rest of the army, since they
 have no part in their leaders' council, but are simply prepared to risk
 their lives in defence of their country, although they may view with
 approval the feats of the wizard, nevertheless escape the sentence of
 excommunication; but they must in their confession acknowledge the guilt
 of the wizard, and in their absolution by the confessor must receive a
 solemn warning to hold all such practices for ever in detestation, and as
 far as they are able drive from their land all such wizards.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It may be asked by whom such princes are to be absolved when they come to
 their senses, whether by their own spiritual advisers or by the Inquisitors?
 We answer that, if they repent, they may be absolved either by their
 spiritual advisers, or by the Inquisitors. This is provided in the Canon Law
 concerning the proceedings to be taken, in the fear of God and as a warning
 to men, against heretics, their followers, protectors, patrons and fautors,
 as also against those who are accused or suspected of heresy. But if any of
 the above, forswearing his former lapse into heresy, wish to return to the
 unity of the Church, he may receive the benefit of absolution provided by
 Holy Church.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A prince, or any other, may be said to have returned to his senses when he
 has delivered up the wizard to be punished for his offences against the
 Creator; when he has banished from his dominions all who have been found
 guilty of witchcraft or heresy; when he is truly penitent for the past; and
 when, as becomes a Catholic prince, he is firmly determined in his mind not
 to show any favour to any other such wizard.

<h2>Question II</h2>
<h3>Introduction, wherein is Set Forth the Difficulty of this Question.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Is it lawful to remove witchcraft by means of further witchcraft, or by any
 other forbidden means?<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is argued that it is not; for it has already been shown that in the
 <i>Second Book of Sentences</i>, and the 8th Distinction, all the Doctors
 agree that it is unlawful to use the help of devils, since to do so involves
 apostasy from the Faith. And, it is argued, no witchcraft can be removed
 without the help of devils. For it is submitted that it must be cured either
 by human power, or by diabolic, or by Divine power. It cannot be by the
 first; for the lower power cannot counteract the higher, having no control
 over that which is outside its own natural capacity. Neither can it be by
 Divine power; for this would be a miracle, which God performs only at His
 own will, and not at the instance of men. For when His Mother besought
 Christ to perform a miracle to supply the need for wine, He answered: Woman,
 what have I to do with thee? And the Doctors explain this as meaning,
 “What association is there between you and me in the working of a
 miracle?” Also it appears that it is
 very rarely that men are delivered from a bewitchment by calling on God's
 help or the prayers of the Saints. Therefore it follows that they can only
 be delivered by the help of devils; and it is unlawful to seek such help.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again it is pointed out that the common method in practice of taking off a
 bewitchment, although it is quite unlawful, is for the bewitched persons to
 resort to wise women, by whom they are very frequently cured, and not by
 priests or exorcists. So experience shows that such curses are effected by
 the help of devils, which it is unlawful to seek; therefore it cannot be
 lawful thus to cure a bewitchment, but it must patiently be borne.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is further argued that S. Thomas and S. Bonaventura, in Book IV, dist.
 34, have said that a bewitchment must be permanent because it can have no
 human remedy; for if there is a remedy, it is either unknown to men or
 unlawful. And these words are taken to mean that this infirmity is incurable
 and must be regarded as permanent; and they add that, even if God should
 provide a remedy by coercing the devil, and the devil should remove his
 plague from a man, and the man should be cured, that cure would not be a
 human one. Therefore, unless God should cure it, it is not lawful for a man
 to himself to try in any way to look for a cure.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the same place these two Doctors add that it is unlawful even to seek a
 remedy by the superadding of another bewitchment. For they say that,
 granting this to be possible, and that the original spell be removed, yet
 the witchcraft is none the less to be considered permanent; for it is in no
 way lawful to invoke the devil's help through witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Further, it is submitted that the exorcisms of the Church are not always
 effective in the repression of devils in the
 matter of bodily afflictions, since such are cured only at the discretion
 of God; but they are effective always against those molestations of devils
 against which they are chiefly instituted, as, for example, against men who
 are possessed, or in the matter of exorcising children.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, it does not follow that, because the devil has been given power over
 someone on account of his sins, that power must come to an end on the
 cessation of the sin. For very often a man may cease from sinning, but his
 sins still remain. So it seems from these sayings that the two Doctors we
 have cited were of the opinion that it is unlawful to remove a bewitchment,
 but that it must be suffered, just as it is permitted by the Lord God, Who
 can remove it when it seems good to Him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Against this opinion it is argued that just as God and Nature do not abound
 in superfluities, so also they are not deficient in necessities; and it is
 a necessity that there should be given to the faithful against such devils'
 work not only a means of protection (of which we treat in the beginning of
 this Second Part), but also curative remedies. For otherwise the faithful
 would not be sufficiently provided for by God, and the works of the devil
 would seem to be stronger than God's work.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also there is the gloss on that text in <i>Job</i>. There is no power on
 earth, etc. The gloss says that, although the devil has power over all
 things human, he is nevertheless subject to the merits of the Saints, and
 even to the merits of saintly men in this life.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, S. Augustine (<i>De moribus Ecclesiae</i>)
 says: No Angel is more powerful than our mind, when we hold fast to God. For
 if power is a virtue in this world, then the mind that keeps close to God is
 more sublime than the whole world. Therefore such minds can undo the works
 of the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Answer</i>. Here are two weighty opinions which, it seems, are at
 complete variance with each other.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For there are certain Theologians and Canonists who agree that it is lawful
 to remove witchcraft even by superstitious and vain means. And of this
 opinion are Duns Scotus, Henry of Segusio,
 and Godfrey, and all the Canonists. But it is the opinion of the other
 Theologians, especially the ancient ones, and of some of the modern ones,
 such as S. Thomas, S. Bonaventura, Blessed Albert, Peter a Palude, and many
 others, that in no case must evil be done that good may result, and that a
 man ought rather to die than consent to be cured by superstitious and vain
 means.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let us now examine their opinions, with a view to bringing them as far as
 possible into agreement. Scotus, in his Fourth Book, dist. 34, on
 obstructions and impotence caused by witchcraft, says that it is foolish
 to maintain that it is unlawful to remove a bewitchment even by superstitious
 and vain means, and that to do so is in no way contrary to the Faith; for he
 who destroys the work of the devil is not an accessory to such works, but
 believes that the devil has the power and inclination to help in the
 infliction of an injury only so long as the outward token or sign of that
 injury endures. Therefore when that token is destroyed he puts an end to the
 injury. And he adds that it is meritorious to destroy the works of the devil.
 But, as he speaks of tokens, we will give an example.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There are women who discover a witch by the following token. When a cow's
 supply of milk has been diminished by witchcraft, they hang a pail of milk
 over the fire, and uttering certain superstitious words, beat the pail with
 a stick. And though it is the pail that the women beat, yet the devil carries
 all those blows to the back of the witch; and in this way both the witch and
 the devil are made weary. But the devil does this in order that he may lead
 on the woman who beats the pail to worse practices. And so, if it were not
 for the risk which it entails, there would be no difficulty in accepting
 the opinion of this learned Doctor. Many other examples could be given.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Henry of Segusio, in his eloquent <i>Summa</i> on genital impotence caused
 by witchcraft, says that in such cases recourse must be had to the remedies
 of physicians; and although some of these remedies seem to be vain and
 superstitious cantrips and charms, yet everyone must be trusted in his own
 profession, and the Church may well tolerate the suppression of vanities by
 means of others vanities.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Ubertinus also, in his Fourth Book, uses
 these words: A bewitchment can be removed either by prayer or by the same
 art by which it was inflicted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Godfrey says in his <i>Summa:</i> A bewitchment cannot always be removed by
 him who caused it, either because he is dead, or because he does not know
 how to cure it, or because the necessary charm is lost. But if he knows how
 to effect relief, it is lawful for him to cure it. Our author is speaking
 against those who said that an obstruction of the carnal act could not be
 caused by witchcraft, and that it could never be permanent, and therefore
 did not annul a marriage already contracted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, those who maintained that no spell is permanent were moved by the
 following reasons: they thought that every bewitchment could be removed
 either by another magic spell, or by the exorcisms of the Church which are
 ordained for the suppression of the devil's power, or by true penitence,
 since the devil has power only over sinners. So in the first respect they
 agree with the opinion of the others, namely, that a spell can be removed by
 superstitious means.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But S. Thomas is of the contrary opinion when he says: If a spell cannot be
 revoked except by some unlawful means, such as the devil's help or anything
 of that sort, even if it is known that it can be revoked in that way, it is
 nevertheless to be considered permanent; for the remedy is not lawful.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Of the same opinion are S. Bonaventura, Peter a Palude, Blessed Albert, and
 all the Theologians. For, touching briefly on the question of invoking the
 help of the devil either tacitly or expressedly, they seem to hold that
 such spells may only be removed by lawful exorcism or true penitence (as is
 set down in the Canon Law concerning sortilege), being moved, as it seems,
 by the considerations mentioned in the beginning of this Question.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it is expedient to bring these various opinions of the learned Doctors
 as far as possible into agreement, and this can be done in one respect. For
 this purpose it is to be noted that the methods by which a spell of
 witchcraft can be removed are as follows: - either by the agency of another
 witch and another spell; or without the agency of a witch, but by means of
 magic and unlawful ceremonies. And this last method may be divided into two;
 namely, the use of ceremonies which are both unlawful and vain, or the use
 of ceremonies which are vain but not unlawful.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The first remedy is altogether unlawful, in respect both of the agent and of
 the remedy itself. But it may be accomplished in two ways; either with some
 injury to him who worked the spell, or without an injury, but with magic and
 unlawful ceremonies. In the latter case it can be included with the second
 method, namely, that by which the spell is removed not by the agency of a
 witch, but by magic and unlawful ceremonies; and in this case it is still to
 be judged unlawful, though not to the same extent as the first method.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We may summarize the position as follows. There are three conditions by
 which a remedy is rendered unlawful. First, when a spell is removed through
 the agency of another witch, and by further witchcraft, that is, by the
 power of some devil. Secondly, when it is not removed by a witch, but by
 some honest person, in such a way, however, that the spell is by some
 magical remedy transferred from one person to another; and this again is
 unlawful. Thirdly, when the spell is removed without imposing it on another
 person, but some open or tacit invocation of devils is used; and then again
 it is unlawful.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is with reference to these methods that the Theologians say that it
 is better to die than to consent to them. But there are two other methods by
 which, according to the Canonists, it is lawful, or not idle and vain, to
 remove a spell; and that such methods may be used when all the remedies of
 the Church, such as exorcisms and the prayers of the Saints and true
 penitence, have been tried and have failed. But for a clearer understanding
 of these remedies we will recount some examples known to our experience.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the time of Pope Nicolas there had come to Rome on some business a
 certain Bishop from Germany, whom it is charitable not to name although he
 had now paid the debt of all nature. There he fell in love with a girl, and
 sent her to his diocese in charge of two servants and certain other of his
 possessions, including some rich jewels, which were indeed very valuable,
 and began to think in her heart that, if only the Bishop were to die through
 some witchcraft, she would be able to take possession of the rings, the
 pendants and carcanets. The next night the Bishop suddenly fell ill, and the
 physicians and his servants gravely suspected that he had been poisoned; for
 there was such a fire in his breast that he had to take continual draughts
 of cold water to assuage it. On the third day, when there seemed no hope of
 his life, an old woman came and begged that she might see him. So they let
 her in, and she promised the Bishop that she could heal him if he would
 agree to her proposals. When the Bishop asked what it was to which he had to
 agree in order to regain his health, as he so greatly desired, the old woman
 answered: Your illness has ben caused by a spell of witchcraft, and you can
 only be healed by another spell, which will transfer the illness from you to
 the witch who caused it, so that she will die. The Bishop was astounded; and
 seeing that he could be healed in no other way, and not wishing to come to a
 rash decision, decided to ask the advice of the Pope. Now the Holy Father
 loved him very dearly, and when he learned that he could only be healed by
 the death of the witch, he agreed to permit the lesser of two evils, and
 signed this permission with his seal. So the old woman was again approached
 and told that both he and the Pope had agreed to the death of the witch, on
 condition that he was restored to his former health; and the old woman went
 away, promising him that he would be healed on the following night. And
 behold! when about the middle of the night he felt himself cured and free
 from all illness, he sent a messenger to learn what had happened to the girl;
 and he came back and reported that she had suddenly been taken ill in the
 middle of the night while sleeping by her mother's side.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is to be understood that at the very same hour and moment the illness
 left the Bishop and afflicted the girl witch, through the agency of the old
 witch; and so the evil spirit, by ceasing to plague the Bishop, appeared to
 restore him to health by chance, whereas it was not he but God who permitted
 him to afflict im, and it was God Who properly speaking restored him; and
 the devil, by reason of his compact with the second witch, who envied the
 fortune of the girl, has to afflict the Bishop's mistress. And it must be
 thought that those two evil spells were not worked by one devil serving two
 persons, but by two devils serving two separate witches. For the devils do
 not work against themselves, but work as much
 as possible in agreement for the perdition of souls.

<h2>Chapter I</h2>
<h3>The Remedies prescribed by the Holy Church against Incubus and Succubus Devils.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 IN the foregoing chapters on the First Question we have treated of the
 methods of bewitching men, animals and the fruits of the earth, and especially
 of the behaviour of witches in their own persons; how they seduce young
 girls in order to increase their numbers; what is their method of profession
 and of offering homage; how they offer to devils their own children and the
 children of others; and how they are transported from place to place. Now I
 say that there is no remedy for such practises, unless witches be entirely
 eradicated by the judges, or at least punished as an example to all who may
 wish to imitate them; but we are not immediately treating of this point,
 which will be dealt with in the last Part of this work, where we set forth
 the twenty ways of proceeding against and sentencing witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the present we are concerned only with the remedies against the injuries
 which they inflict; and first how men who are bewitched can be cured;
 secondly, beasts, and thirdly, how the fruits of the earth may be secured
 from blight or phylloxera.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 With regard to the bewitchment of human beings by means of Incubus and
 Succubus devils, it is to be noted that this can happen in three ways.
 First, when women voluntarily prostitute themselves to Incubus devils.
 Secondly, when men have connexion with Succubus devils; yet it does not
 appear that men thus devilishly fornicate with the same full degree of
 culpability; for men, being by nature intellectually stronger than women,
 are more apt to abhor such practises.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is in the town of Coblenz a poor man who is bewitched in this way.
 In the presence of his wife he is in the habit of acting after the manner
 of men with women, that is to say, of practising coition, as it were, and
 he continues to do this repeatedly, nor have the cries and urgent appeals
 of his wife any effect in making him desist. And after he has fornicated
 thus two or three times, he bawls out, “We are going to start all
 over again”; when actually there is no person visible to mortal sight
 lying with him. And after an incredible number of such bouts, the poor man
 at last sinks to the floor utterly exhausted. When he has recovered his
 strength a little and is asked how this happened to him, and whether he has
 had any women with him, he answers that he saw nothing, but his mind is in
 some way possessed so that he can by no means refrain from such priapism.
 And indeed he harbours a great suspicion that a certain woman bewitched him
 in this way, because he had offended her, and she had cursed him with
 threatening words, telling him what she would like to happen to him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there are no laws or ministers of justice which can proceed to the
 avenging of so great a crime with no other warrant than a vague charge or a
 grave suspicion; for it is held that no one ought to be condemned unless he
 has been convicted by his own confession, or by the evidence of three
 trustworthy witnesses, since the mere fact of the crime coupled with even the
 gravest suspicions against some person is not sufficient to warrant the
 punishment of that person. But this matter will be dealt with later.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As for instances where young maidens are molested by Incubus devils in this
 way, it would take too long to mention even those that have been known to
 happen in our own time, for there are very many well-attested stories of
 such bewitchments. But the great difficulty of finding a remedy for such
 afflictions can be illustrated from a story told by Thomas of Brabant in his
 <i>Book on Bees</i>.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I saw, he writes, and heard the confession of a virgin in a religious habit,
 who said at first that she had never been a consenting party to fornication,
 but at the same time have been known in this way. This I could not believe,
 but narrowly charged and exhorted her, with the most solemn adjurations, to
 speak the truth on peril of her very soul. At last, weeping bitterly, she
 acknowledged that she had been corrupted rather in mind than in body; and
 that though she had afterwards grieved almost to death, and had daily
 confessed with tears, yet by no device or study or art could she be delivered
 from an Incubus devil, nor yet by the sign of
 the Cross, nor by Holy Water, which are specially ordained for the expulsion
 of devils, nor even by the Sacrament of the Body of Our Lord, which even the
 Angels fear. But at last after many years of prayer and fasting she was
 delivered.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It may be believed (saving a better judgement) that, after she repented and
 confessed her sin, the Incubus devil should be regarded rather in the light
 of a punishment for sin than as a sin in itself.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A devout nun, named Christina, in the Low Country of the Duchy of Brabant,
 told me the following concerning this same woman. On the vigil of one
 Pentacost the woman came to her complaining that she dared not take the
 Sacrament because of the importunate molestation of a devil. Christina,
 pitying her, said: “Go, and rest assured that you will receive the
 Body of Our Lord to-morrow; for I will take your punishment upon myself.”
 So she went away joyfully, and after praying the night slept in peace, and
 rose up in the morning and communicated in all tranquility of the soul. But
 Christina, not thinking of the punishment she had taken upon herself, went
 to her rest in the evening, and as she lay in bed hear, as it were, a violent
 attack being made upon her; and, seizing whatever it was by the throat,
 tried to throw it off. She lay down again, but was again molested, and rose
 up in terror; and this happened many times, whilst all the straw of her bed
 was turned over and thrown about everywhere, so at length she perceived that
 she was being persecuted by the malice of a devil. Thereupon she left her
 pallet, and passed a sleepless night; and when she wished to pray, she was
 so tormented by the devil that she said she had never suffered so much
 before. In the morning, therefore, saying to the other woman, “I
 renounce your punishment, and I am hardly alive to renounce it,” she
 escaped from the violence of that wicked tempter. From this it can be seen
 how difficult it is to cure this sort of evil, whether or not it is due to
 witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 However, there are still some means by which these devils may be driven
 away, of which Nider writes in his <i>Formicarius</i>. He says that there
 are five ways by which girls or men can be delivered: first, by Sacramental
 Confession; second, by the Sacred Sign of the Cross, or by the recital of
 the Angelic Salutation; third, by the use of exorcisms; fourth, by moving to
 another place; and fifth, by means of excommunication prudently employed by
 holy men. It is evident from what has been said that the first two methods
 did not avail the nun; but they are not on that account to be neglected,
 for that which cures one person does not necessarily cure another, and
 conversely. And it is a recorded fact that Incubus devils have often been
 driven away by the Lord's Prayer, or by the sprinkling of Holy Water, and
 also especially by the Angelic Salutation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For S. Caesarius tells in his <i>Dialogue</i>
 that, after a certain priest had hanged himself, his concubine entered a
 convent, where she was carnally solicited by an Incubus. She drove him away
 by crossing herself and using Holy Water, yet he immediately returned. But
 when she recited the Angelic Salutation, he vanished like an arrow shot
 from a bow; still he came back, although he did not dare to come near her,
 because of the Ave MARIA.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 S. Caesarius also refers to the remedy of Sacramental Confession. For he
 says that the aforesaid concubine was entirely abandoned by the Incubus
 after she was clean confessed. He tells also of a man in Leyden who was
 plagued by a Succubus, and was entirely delivered after Sacramental
 Confession.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 He adds yet another example, of an enclosed nun, a contemplative, whom an
 Incubus would not leave in spite of prayers and confession and other
 religious exercises. For he persisted in forcing his way to her bed. But
 when, acting on the advice of a certain religious man, she uttered the word
 Benedicite, the devil at once left her.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Of the fourth method, that of moving to another place, he says that a
 certain priest's daughter had been defiled by an Incubus and driven frantic
 with grief; but when she went away across the Rhine, she was left in peace
 by the Incubus. Her father, however, because he had sent her away, was so
 afflicted by the devil that he died within three days.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 He also maintains a woman who was often molested by an Incubus in her own
 bed, and asked a devout friend of hers to come and sleep with her. She did
 so, and was troubled all night with the utmost uneasiness and disquiet, and
 then the first woman was left in peace. William of Paris notes also that
 Incubus seem chiefly to molest women and girls with beautiful hair; either
 because they devote themselves too much to the care and adornment of their
 hair, or because they are boastfully vain about it, or because God in His
 goodness permits this so that women may be afraid to entice men by the very
 means by which the devils wish them to entice men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The fifth method, that of excommunication, which is perhaps the same as
 exorcism, is exemplified in a history of S. Bernard. In Aquitaine a woman
 had for six years been molested by an Incubus with incredible carnal abuse
 and lechery; and she heard the Incubus threaten her that she must not go
 near the holy man, who was coming that way, saying: “It will avail
 you nothing: for when he was gone away, I, who have till now been your
 lover, will become the cruellest of tyrants to you.” None the less
 she went to S. Bernard, and he said to her: “Take my staff and set it
 in your bed, and may the devil do what he can.” When she had done this,
 the devil did not dare to enter the woman's room, but threatened her terribly
 from outside, saying that he would persecute her when S. Bernard had gone
 away. When S. Bernard heard this from the woman, he called the people
 together, bidding them carry lighted candles in their hands, and, with the
 whole assembly which was gathered, excommunicated the devil, forbidding him
 evermore to approach that woman or any other. And so she was delivered from
 that punishment.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be noted that the power of the Keys granted to S. Peter and
 his successors, which resounds on the earth, is really a power of healing
 granted to the Church on behalf of travellers who are subject to the
 jurisdiction of the Papal power; therefore is seems wonderful that even the
 Powers of the air can be warded off by this virtue. But it must be remembered
 that persons who are molested by devils are under the jurisdiction of the
 Pope and his Keys; and therefore it is not surprising if such Powers are
 indirectly kept at bay by the virtue of the Keys, just as by the same virtue
 the souls in purgatory can indirectly by delivered from the pains of fire;
 insasmuch as this Power availeth upon the earth, ay, and to the relief of
 souls that are under the earth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it is not seemly to discuss the Power of the Keys granted to the Head
 of the Church as Christ's Vicar; since it is know that, for the use of the
 Church, Christ granted to the Church and His Vicar as much power as it is
 possible for God to grant to mere man.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is piously to be believed that, when infirmities inflicted by witches
 through the power of devils, together with the witches and devils themselves,
 are excommunicated, those who were afflicted will no longer be tormented;
 and that they will be delivered all the sooner by the use of other lawful
 exorcisms in addition.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is a common report current in the districts of the river Etsch, as
 also in other places, that by the permission of God a swarm of locusts came
 and devoured all the vines, green leaves and crops; and that they were
 suddenly put to flight and dispersed by means of this kind of excommunication
 and cursing. Now it any wish that this should ascribed to some holy man, and
 not to the virtue of the Keys, let ie be so, in the name of the Lord; but of
 one thing we are certain, that both the power to perform miracles and the
 power of the Keys necessarily presuppose a condition of grace in him who
 performs that act of grace, since both these powers proceed from grace
 granted to men who are in a state of grace.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, it is to be noted that, if none of the aforesaid remedies are of any
 avail, then recourse must be had to the usual exorcisms, of which we shall
 treat later. And if even these are not sufficient to banish the iniquity of
 the devil, then that affliction must be considered to be an expiatory
 punishment for sin, which should be borne in all meekness, as are other ills
 of this sort which oppress us that they may, as it were, drive us to seek
 God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it must also be remarked that sometimes persons only think they are
 molested by an Incubus when they are not so actually; and this is more apt
 to be the case with women than with men, for they are more timid and liable
 to imagine extraordinary things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In this connexion William of Paris is often quoted. He says: Many
 phantastical apparitions occur to person suffering fro a melancholy disease,
 especially to women, as is shown by their dreams and visions. And the reason
 for this, as physicians know, is that women's souls are by nature far more
 easily and lightly impressionable than men's souls. And he adds: I know that
 I have seen a woman who thought that a devil copulated with her from inside,
 and said she was physically conscious of such incredible things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 At time also women think they have been made pregnant by an Incubus, and
 their bellies grow to an enormous size; but when the time of parturition
 comes, their swelling is relieved by no more than the expulsion of a great
 quantity of wind. For by taking ants' eggs in drink, or the seeds of spurge
 or of the black pine, an incredible amount of wind and flatulence is
 generated in the human stomach. And it is very easy for the devil to cause
 these and even greater disorders in the stomach. This has been set down in
 order that too easy credence should not be given to women, but only to
 those whom experience has shown to be trustworthy, and to those who, by
 sleeping in their beds or near them, know for a fact that such things as we
 have spoken of are true.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter II</h2>
<h3>Remedies prescribed for Those who are Bewitched by the Limitation of the Generative Power.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Although far more women are witches than men, as was shown in the
 First Part of the work, yet men are more often bewitched than
 women. And the reason for this lies in the fact that God allows
 the devil more power over the venereal act, by which the original
 sin is handed down, than over other human actions. In the same
 way He allows more witchcraft to be performed by means of
 serpents, which are more subject to incantations than other
 animals, because that was the first instrument of the devil. And
 the venereal act can be more readily and easily bewitched in a
 man than in a woman, as has been clearly shown. For there are
 five ways in which the devil can impede the act of generation,
 and they are more easily operated against men.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As far as possible we shall set out the remedies which can be
 applies in each separate kind of obstruction; and let him who is
 bewitched in this faculty take note to which class of obstruction
 he belongs. For there are five classes, according to Peter a
 Palude in his Fourth Book, dist. 34, of the trial of this sort of
 bewitchment.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the devil, being a spirit, has by his very nature power, with
 God's permission,  over a bodily creature, especially to promote
 or to prevent local motion. So by this power they can prevent the
 bodies of men and women from approaching each other; and this
 either directly or indirectly. Directly, when they remove one to
 a distance from another, and do not allow him to approach the
 other. Indirectly, when they cause some obstruction, or when they
 interpose themselves in an assumed body. So it happened that a
 young Pagan who had married an idol, but none the less contracted
 a marriage with a girl; but because of this he was unable to
 copulate with her, as has been shown above.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, the devil can inflame a man towards one woman and
 render him impotent towards another; and this he can secretly
 cause by the application of certain herbs or other matters of
 which he well knows the virtue for this purpose.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, he can disturb the apperception of a man or a woman, so
 that he makes one appear hideous to the other; for, as has been
 shown, he can influence the imagination.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fourthly, he can suppress the vigour of that member which is
 necessary for procreation; just as he can deprive any organ of
 the power of local motion.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fifthly, he can prevent the flow of the semen to the members in
 which is the motive power, by as it were closing the seminal duct
 so that it does not descend to the genital vessels, or does not
 ascend again from them, or cannot come forth, or is spent vainly.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if a man should say: I do not know by which of these
 different methods I have been bewitched; all I know is that I
 cannot do anything with my wife: he should be answered in this
 way. If he is active and able with regard to other women, but not
 with his wife, then he is bewitched in the second way; for he can
 be certified as to the first way, that he is being deluded by
 Succubus or Incubus devils. Moreover, if he does not find his
 wife repellent, and yet cannot know her, but can know other
 women, then again it is the second way; but if he finds her
 repellent and cannot copulate with her, then it is the second and
 the third way. If he does not find her repellent and wishes to
 have connexion with her, but has no power in his member, then it
 is the fourth way. But if he has power in his member, yet cannot
 emit his semen, then it is the fifth way. The method of curing
 these will be shown where we consider whether those who live in
 grace and those who do not are equally liable to be bewitched in
 these manners; and we answer that they are not, with the
 exception of the fourth manner, and even then very rarely. For
 such an affliction can happen to a man living in grace and
 righteousness; but the reader must understand that in this case
 we speak of the conjugal act between married people; for in any
 other case they are all liable to bewitchment; for every venereal
 act outside wedlock is a mortal sin, and is only committed by
 those who are not in a state of grace.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We have, indeed, the authority of the whole of Scriptural
 teaching that God allows the devil to afflict sinners more than
 the just. For although that most just man, Job, was stricken, yet
 he was not so particularly or directly in respect of the
 procreant function. And it may be said that, when a married
 couple are afflicted in this way, either both the parties or one
 of them is not living in a state of grace; and this opinion is
 substantiated in the Scriptures both by authority and by reason.
 For the Angel said to Tobias: The
 devil receives power against those who are given over to lust:
 and he proved it in the slaying of the seven husbands of the
 virgin Sara.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Cassian, in his <i>Collation of the Fathers</i>, quotes S. Antony as
 saying that the devil can in no way enter our mind or body unless
 he has first deprived it of all holy thoughts and made it empty
 and bare of spiritual contemplation. These words should not be
 applies to an evil affliction over the whole of the body, for
 when Job was so afflicted he was not denuded of Divine grace; but
 they have particular reference to a particular infirmity
 inflicted upon the body for some sin. And the infirmity we are
 considering can only be due to the sin of incontinence. For, as
 we have said, God allows the devil more power over that act than
 over other human acts, because of its natural nastiness, and
 because by it the first sin was handed down to posterity.
 Therefore when people joined in matrimony have for some sin been
 deprived of Divine help, God allows them to be bewitched chiefly
 in their procreant functions.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if it is asked of what sort are those sins, it can be said,
 according to S. Jerome, that even in a state of matrimony it is
 possible to commit the sin of incontinence in various ways. See
 the text: He who loves his wife to excess is an adulterer. And
 they who love in this way are more liable to be bewitched after
 the manner we have said.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The remedies of the Church, then, are twofold: one applicable in
 the public court, the other in the tribunal of the confessional.
 As for the first, when it has been publicly found that the
 impotence is due to witchcraft, then it must be distinguished
 whether it is temporary or permanent. If it is only temporary, it
 does not annul the marriage. And it is assumed to be temporary
 if, within the space of three years, by using every possible
 expedient of the Sacraments of the Church and other remedies, a
 cure can be caused. But if, after that time, they cannot be cured
 by any remedy, then it is assumed to be permanent.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now the disability either precedes both the contract and the
 consummation of marriage; and in this case it impedes the
 contract: or it follows the contract but precedes the
 consummation; and in this case it annuls the contract. For men
 are very often bewitched in this way because they have cast off
 their former mistresses, who, hoping that they were to be married
 and being disappointed, so bewitch the men that they cannot
 copulate with another woman. And in such a case, according to the
 opinion of many, the marriage already contracted is annulled,
 unless, like Our Blessed Lady and S. Joseph they are willing to
 live together in holy continence. This opinion is supported by
 the Canon where it says (23, q. I) that a marriage is confirmed
 by the carnal act. And a little later it says that impotence
 before such confirmation dissolves the ties of marriage.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Or else the disability follows the consummation of a marriage,
 and then it does not dissolve the bonds of matrimony. Much more
 to this effect is noted by the Doctors, where in various writings
 they treat of the obstruction due to witchcraft; but since it is
 not precisely relevant to the present inquiry, it is here
 omitted.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But some may find it difficult to understand how this function
 can be obstructed in respect of one woman but not of another. S.
 Bonaventura answers that this may be because some witch has
 persuaded the devil to effect this only with respect to one
 woman, or because God will not allow the obstruction to apply
 save to some particular woman. The judgement of God in this
 matter is a mystery, as in the case of the wife of Tobias. But
 how the devil procures this disability is plainly shown by what
 has already been said. And S. Bonaventura says that he obstructs
 the procreant function, not intrinsically by harming the organ,
 but extrinsically by impeding its use; and it is an artificial,
 not a natural impediment; and so he an cause it to apply to one
 woman and not to another. Or else he takes away all desire for
 one or another woman; and this he does by his own power, or else
 by means of some herb or stone or some occult creature. And in
 this he is in substantial agreement with Peter a Palude.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The ecclesiastical remedy in the tribunal of God is set forth in
 the Canon where it says: If with the permission of the just and
 secret judgement of God, through the arts of sorceresses and
 witches and the preparation of the devil, men are bewitched in
 their procreant function, they are to be urged to make clean
 confession to God and His priest of all their sins with a
 contrite heart and a humble spirit; and to make satisfaction to
 God with many tears and large offerings and prayers and fasting.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From these words it is clear that such afflictions are only on
 account of sin, and occur only to those who do not live in a
 state of grace. It proceeds to tell how the ministers of the
 Church can effect a cure by means of exorcisms and the other
 protections and cures provided by the Church. In this way, with
 the help of God, Abraham cured by his prayers
 Abimelech and his house.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In conclusion we may say that there are five remedies which may
 lawfully be applied to those who are bewitched in this way:
 namely, a pilgrimage to some holy and venerable shrine; true
 confession of their sins with contrition; the plentiful use of
 the sign of the Cross and devout prayer; lawful exorcism by
 solemn words, the nature of which will be explained later; and
 lastly, a remedy can be effected by prudently approaching the
 witch, as was shown in the case of the Count who for three years
 was unable to cohabit carnally with a virgin whom he had married.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter III</h2>
<h3>Remedies prescribed for those who are Bewitched by being Inflamed with Inordinate Love or Extraordinary Hatred.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 JUST as the generative faculty can be bewitched, so can inordinate love or
 hatred be caused in the human mind. First we shall consider the cause of
 this, and then, as far as possible, the remedies.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 <i>Philocaption</i>, or inordinate love of one person for another, can be
 caused in three ways. Sometimes it is due merely to a lack of control over
 the eyes; sometimes to the temptation of devils; sometimes to the spells of
 necromancers and witches, with the help of devils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The first is spoken of in <i>S. James</i> i. 14, 15: Every man is tempted
 by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured. Then when
 concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: but sin, when it is
 completed, begetteth death. And so, when Shecham saw Dinah going out to see
 the daughters of the land, he loved her, and ravished her, and lay with her,
 and his soul clave unto her (<i>Genesis</i> xxxiv). And here the gloss says
 that this happened to an infirm spirit because she left her own concerns to
 inquire into those of other people; and such a soul is seduced by bad habits,
 and is led to consent to unlawful practices.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second cause arises from the temptation of devils. In this way Amnon
 loved his beautiful sister Tamar, and was so vexed that he fell sick for
 love of her (II. <i>Samuel</i> xiii). For he could not have been so totally
 corrupt in his mind as to fall into so great a crime of incest unless he had
 been grievously tempted by the devil. The book of the Holy Fathers refers to
 this kind of love, where it says that even in their hermitages they were
 exposed to every temptation, including that of carnal desires; for some of
 them were at times tempted with the love of women more than it is possible
 to believe. S. Paul also says, in II. <i>Corinthians</i> xii: There was
 given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me: and
 the gloss explains this as referring to the temptation of lust.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it is said that when a man does not give way to temptation he does not
 sin, but it is an exercise for his virtue; but this is to be understood of
 the temptation of the devil, not of that of the flesh; for this is a venial
 sin even if a man does not yield to it. Many examples of this are to be read.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As for the third cause, by which inordinate love proceeds from devils' and
 witches' works, the possibility of this sort of witchcraft has been
 exhaustively considered in the Questions of the First Part as to whether
 devils through the agency of witches can turn the minds of men to inordinate
 love or hatred, and it was proved by examples which had fallen within our
 own experience. Indeed this is the best known and most general form of
 witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the following question may be asked: Peter has been seized with an
 inordinate love of this description, but he does not know whether it is due
 to the first or the second or the third cause. It must be answered that it
 can be by the work of the devil that hatred is stirred up between married
 people so as to cause the crime of adultery. But when a man is so bound in
 the meshes of carnal lust and desire that he can be made to desist from it
 by no shame, words, blows or action; and when a man often puts away his
 beautiful wife to cleave to the most hideous of women, and when he cannot
 rest in the night, but is so demented that he must go by devious ways to his
 mistress; and when it is found that those of noblest birth, Governors, and
 other rich men, are the most miserably involved in this sin (for this age is
 dominated by women, and was foretold by
 S. Hildegard, as Vincent of Beauvais records
 in the <i>Mirror of History</i>, although he said it would note endure for
 as long as it already has); and when the world is now full of adultery,
 especially among the most highly born; when all this is considered, I say,
 of what use is it to speak of remedies to those who desire no remedy?
 Nevertheless, for the satisfaction of the pious reader, we will set down
 briefly some of the remedies for <i>Philocaption</i> when it is not due to
 witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Avicenna mentions seven remedies which may be used when a man is made
 physically ill by this sort of love; but they are hardly relevant to our
 inquiry except in so far as they may be of service to the sickness of the
 soul. For he says, in Book III, that the root of the sickness may be
 discovered by feeling the pulse and uttering the name of the object of the
 patient's love; and then, if the law permits, he may be cured by yielding
 to nature. Or certain medicines may be applied, concerning which he gives
 instructions. Or the sick man may be turned from his love by lawful remedies
 which will cause him to direct his love to a more worthy object. Or he may
 avoid her presence, and so distract his mind from her. Or, if he is open to
 correction, he may be admonished and expostulated with, to the effect that
 such love is the greatest misery. Or he may be directed to someone who, as
 far as he may with God's truth, will vilify the body and disposition of his
 love, and so blacken her character that she may appear to him altogether
 base and deformed. Or, finally, he is to be set to arduous duties which may
 distract his thoughts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Indeed, just as the animal nature of man may be cured by such remedies, so
 may they all be of use in reforming his inner spirit. Let a man obey the law
 of his intellect  rather than that of nature, let him turn his love to safe
 pleasures, let him remember how momentary is the fruition of lust and how
 eternal the punishment, let him seek his pleasure in that life where joys
 begin never to end, and let him consider that if he cleaves to this earthly
 love, that will be his sole reward, but he will lose the bliss of Heaven,
 and be condemned to eternal fire: behold! the three irrevocable losses which
 proceed from inordinate lust.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 With regard to <i>Philocaption</i> caused by witchcraft, the remedies detailed
 in the preceding chapter may not inconveniently be applied here also;
 especially the exorcisms by sacred words which the bewitched person can
 himself use. Let him daily invoke the Guardian Angel deputed to him by God,
 let him use confession and frequent the shrines of the Saints, especially
 of the Blessed Virgin, and without doubt he will be delivered.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But how abject are those strong men who, discarding their natural gifts and
 the armour of virtue, cease to defend themselves; whereas the girls
 themselves in their invincible frailty use those very rejected weapons to
 repel this kind of witchcraft. We give one out of many examples in their
 praise.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There was in a country village near Lindau in the diocese of Constance a
 grown maid fair to see and of even more elegant behaviour, at sight of whom
 a certain man of loose principles, a cleric in sooth, but not a priest, was
 smitten with violent pangs of love. And being unable to conceal the wound in
 his heart any longer, he went to the place where the girl was working, and
 with fair words showed that he was in the net of the devil, beginning by
 venturing in words only to persuade the girl to grant him her love. She,
 perceiving by Divine instinct his meaning, and being chaste in mind and body,
 bravely answered him: Master, do not come to my house with such words, for
 modesty itself forbids. To this he replied: Although you will not be
 persuaded by gentle words to love me, yet I promise you that soon you will
 be compelled by my deeds to love me. Now that man was a suspected enchanter
 and wizard. The maiden considered his words as but empty air, and until then
 felt in herself no spark of carnal love for him; but after a short time she
 began to have amorous thoughts. Perceiving this, and being inspired by God,
 she sought the protection of the Mother of Mercy, and devoutly implored Her
 to intercede with Her Son to help her. Anxious, moreover, she went on a
 pilgrimage to a hermitage, where there was a
 church miraculously consecrated in that diocese to the Mother of God. There
 she confessed her sins, so that no evil spirit could enter her, and after
 her prayers to the Mother of Pity all the devil's machinations against her
 ceased, so that these evil crafts thenceforth never afflicted her.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 None the less there are still some strong men cruelly enticed by witches to
 this sort of love, so that it would seem that they could never restrain
 themselves from their inordinate lust for them, yet these often most
 manfully resist the temptation of lewd and filthy enticements, and by the
 aforesaid defences overcome all the wiles of the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A rich young man in the town of Innsbruck provides us with a notable pattern
 of this sort of struggle. He was so importuned by witches that it is hardly
 possible for pen to describe his strivings, but he always kept a brave heart,
 and escaped by means of the remedies we have mentioned. Therefore it may
 justly be concluded that these remedies are infallible against this disease,
 and that they who use such weapons will most surely be delivered.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it must be understood that what we have said concerning inordinate love
 applies also to inordinate hatred, since the same discipline is of benefit
 for the two opposite extremes. But though the degree of witchcraft is equal
 in each, yet there is this difference in the case of hatred; the person who
 is hated must seek another remedy. For the man who hates his wife and puts
 her out of his heart will not easily, if he is an adulterer, be turned back
 again to his wife, even though he go on many a pilgrimage.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now it has been learned from witches that they cause this spell of hatred by
 means of serpents; for the serpent was the first instrument of the devil,
 and by reason of its curse inherits a hatred of women; therefore they cause
 such spells by placing the skin or head of a serpent under the threshold of
 a room or house. For this reason all the nooks and corners of the house
 where such a woman lives are to be closely examined and reconstructed as far
 as possible; or else she must be lodged in the houses of others.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And when it is said the bewitched men can exorcise themselves, it is to be
 understood that they can wear the sacred words or benedictions of
 incantations round their necks, if they are unable to read or pronounce the
 benedictions; but it will be shown later in what way this should be done.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter IV</h2>
<h3>Remedies presribed for those who by Prestidigitative Art have lost their Virile Members or have seemingly been Transformed into the Shapes of Beasts.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In what has already been written it has clearly enough been shown
 the remedies which are available for the relief of those who are
 deluded by a glamour, and think that they have lost their virile
 member, or have been metamorphosed into animals. For since such
 men are entirely destitute of Divine grace, according to the
 essential condition of those who are so bewitched, it is not
 possible to apply a healing salve while the weapon still remains
 in the wound. Therefore before all things they must be reconciled
 to God by a good confession. Again, as was shown in the seventh
 chapter of the First Question of the Second Part, such members
 are never actually taken away from the body, but are only hidden
 by a glamour from the senses of sight and touch. It is clear,
 too, that those who live in grace are not so easily deluded in
 this way, either actively or passively, in such a manner, that
 is, that they seem to lose their members, or that those of others
 should appear to them to be missing. Therefore the remedy as well
 as the disease is explained in that chapter, namely, that they
 should as far as possible come to an amicable agreement with the
 witch herself.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As to those who think that they have been changed into beasts, it
 must be known that this kind of witchcraft is more practised in
 Easter countries than in the West; that is to say, in the East
 witches more often bewitch other people in this way, but it
 appears that the witches so transform themselves more frequently
 in our part of the world; namely, when they change themselves, in
 full sight, into the shapes of animals, as was told in the eighth
 chapter. Therefore in their case the remedies to be used are
 those set out in the Third Part of this work, where we deal with
 the extermination of witches by the secular arm of the law.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But in the East the following remedy is used for such delusions.
 For we have learned much of this matter from the Knights of the
 Order of S. John of Jerusalem in Rhodes; and especially this case
 which happened in the city of Salamis in the kingdom of Cyprus.
 For that is a seaport, and once when a vessel was being laden
 with merchandise suitable for a ship which is sailing into
 foreign parts, and all her company were providing themselves with
 victuals, one of them, a strong young man, went to the house of a
 woman standing outside the city on the seashore, and asked her if
 she had any eggs to sell. The woman, seeing that he was a strong
 young man, and a merchant far away from his own country, thought
 that on that account the people of the city would feel less
 suspicion if he were to be lost, and said to him: “Wait a little,
 and I will get you all that you want.” And when she went in and
 shut the door and kept him waiting, the young man outside began
 to call out to her to hurry, lest he should miss the ship. Then
 the woman brought some eggs and gave them to the young man, and
 told him to hurry back tot he ship in case he should miss it. So
 he hastened back to the ship, which was anchored by the shore,
 and before going on board, since the full company of his
 companions was not yet returned, he decided to eat the eggs there
 and refresh himself. And behold! an hour later he was made dumb
 as if he had no power of speech; and, as he afterwards said, he
 wondered what could have happened to him, but was unable to find
 out. Yet when he wished to go on board, he was driven off with
 sticks by those who yet remained ashore, and who all cried out:
 “Look what this ass is doing! Curse the beast, you are not coming
 on board.” The young man being thus driven away, and
 understanding from their words that they thought he was an ass,
 reflected and began to suspect that he had been bewitched by the
 woman, especially since he could utter no word, although he
 understood all that was said. And when, on again trying to board
 the ship, he was driven off with heavier blows, he was in
 bitterness of heart compelled to remain and watch the ship sail
 away. And so, as he ran here and there, since everybody thought
 he was an ass, he was necessarily treated as such. At last, under
 compulsion, he went back to the woman’s house, and to keep
 himself alive served her at her pleasure for three years, doing
 no work but to bring to the house such necessities as wood and
 corn, and to carry away what had to be carried away like a beast
 of burden: the only consolation that was left to him being that
 although everyone else took him for an ass, the witches
 themselves, severally and in company, who frequented the house,
 recognized him as a man, and he could talk and behave with them
 as a man should.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now if it is asked how burdens were placed upon him as if he were
 a beast, we must say that this case is analogous to that of which
 S. Augustine speaks in his <i>De Ciuitate Dei</i>, Book XVIII,
 chapter 17, where he tells of the tavern women who changed their
 guests into beasts of burden; and to that of the father
 Praestantius, who thought he was a pack-horse and carried corn
 with other animals. For the delusion caused by this glamour was
 threefold.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First in its effect on the men who saw the young man not as a man
 but as an ass; and it is shown above in Chapter VIII how devils
 can easily cause this. Secondly, those burdens were no illusion;
 abut when they were beyond the strength of the young man, the
 devil invisible carried them. Thirdly, that when he was
 consorting with others, the young man himself considered in his
 imagination and perceptive faculties at least, which are
 faculties belonging to the bodily organs, that he was an ass; but
 not in his reason: for he as not so bound but that he knew
 himself to be a man, although he was magically deluded into
 imagining himself a beast. Nabuchodonosor provides an example of
 the same delusion.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 After three years had passed in this way, in the fourth year it
 happened that the young man went one morning into the city, with
 the woman following a long way behind; and he passed by a church
 where Holy Mass was being celebrated, and heard the sacred-bell
 ring at the elevation of the Host (for in that kingdom the Mass
 is celebrated according to the Latin, and not according to the
 Greek rite). And he turned towards the church, and, not daring to
 enter for fear of being driven off with blows, knelt down outside
 by bending the knees of his hind legs, and lifted his forelegs,
 that is, his hands, joined together over his ass’s head, as it
 was thought to be, and looked upon the elevation of the
 Sacrament. And when some Genoese
 merchants saw this prodigy, they followed the ass in
 astonishment, discussing this marvel among themselves; and
 behold! the witch came and belaboured the ass with her stick. And
 because, as we have said, this sort of witchcraft is better known
 in those parts, at the instance of the merchants the ass and the
 witch were taken before the judge; where, being questioned and
 tortured, she confessed her crime and promised to restore the
 young man to his true shape if she might be allowed to return to
 her house. So she was dismissed and went back to her house, where
 the young man was restored to his former shape; and being again
 arrested, she paid the debt which her crimes merited. And the
 young man returned joyfully to his own country.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 2</h1>
<h2>Chapter V</h2>
<h3>Prescribed Remedies for those who are Obsessed owing to some Spell.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We have shown in Chapter X of the preceding Question that sometimes devils,
 through witchcraft, substantially inhabit certain men, and why they do this:
 namely, that it may be for some grave crime of the man himself, and for his
 own ultimate benefit; or sometimes for the slight fault of another man;
 sometimes for a man's own venial sin; and sometimes for another man's grave
 sin. For any of these reasons a man may in varying degrees be possessed by
 a devil. Nider in his <i>Formicarius</i> states that there is no cause for
 wonder if devils, at the instance of witches and with God's permission,
 substantially take possession of men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is clear also from the details given in that chapter what are the remedies
 by which such men can be liberated; namely, by the exorcisms of the Church;
 and by true contrition and confession, when a man is possessed for some
 mortal sin. An example is the manner in which that Bohemian priest was set
 free. But there are three other remedies besides, which are of virtue;
 namely, the Holy Communion of the Eucharist, the visitation of shrines and
 the prayers of holy men, and by lifting the sentence of excommunication. Of
 these we shall speak, although they are plainly set out in the discourses
 of the Doctors, since all have not easy access to the necessary treatises.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Cassian, in his <i>Collation of the Abbots</i>, speaks in these words of the
 Eucharist: We do not remember that our elders ever forbade the administration
 of the Holy Communion to those possessed by evil spirits; it should even be
 given to them every day if possible. For it
 must be believed that It is of great virtue in the purgation and protection
 of both soul and body; and that when a man receives It, the evil spirit
 which afflicts his members or lurks hidden in them is driven away as if it
 were burned with fire. And lately we saw the Abbot Andronicus healed in this
 way; and the devil will rage with mad fury when he feels himself shut out by
 the heavenly medicine, and he will try the harder and the oftener to inflict
 his tortures, as he feels himself driven farther off by this spiritual
 remedy. So says S. John Cassian.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again he adds: Two things must be steadfastly believed. First, that
 without the permission of God no one is altogether possessed by these
 spirits. Second, that everything which God permits to happen to us, whether
 it seem to be sorrow or gladness, is sent for out good as from a pitying
 Father and merciful Physician. For the devils are, as it were, schoolmasters
 of humility, so that they who descend from this world may either be purged
 for the eternal life or be sentenced to the pain of their punishment; and
 such, according to S. Paul, are in the present life delivered unto Satan
 for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day
 of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But here there arises a doubt. For S. Paul says: Let a man examine himself,
 and so eat of the Bread: then how can a man who is possessed communicate,
 since he has not the use of his reason? S. Thomas answers this in his Third
 Part, Question 80, saying that there are distinct degrees in madness. For to
 say that a man has not the use of his reason may mean two things. In one
 case he has some feeble power of reason; as a man is said to be blind when
 he can nevertheless see imperfectly. And since such men can to some extent
 join in the devotion of this Sacrament, it is not to be denied to them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But others are said to be mad because they have been so from birth; and
 such may not partake of the Sacrament, since they are in no way able to
 engage in devout preparation for it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Or perhaps they have not always been without the use of their reason; and
 then, if when they were sane they appeared to appreciate the devotion due
 to the Sacrament, It should be administered to them when they are at the
 point of death, unless it is feared that they may vomit or spew It out.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The following decision is recorded by the Council
 of Carthage (26, q. 6). When a sick man wishes to confess, and if on the
 arrival of the priest he is rendered dumb by his infirmity, or falls into a
 frenzy, those who have heard him speak must give their testimony. And if he
 is thought to be at the point of death, let him be reconciled with God by
 the laying on of hands and the placing of the Sacrament in his mouth. S.
 Thomas also says that the same procedure may be used with baptized people
 who are bodily tormented by unclean spirits, and with other mentally
 distracted persons. And he adds, in Book IV, dist. 9, that the Communion
 must not be denied to demoniacs unless it is certain that they are being
 tortured by the devil for some crime. To this Peter of Palude adds: In this
 case they are to be considered as persons to be excommunicated and delivered
 up to Satan.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this it is clear that, even if a man be possessed by a devil for his
 own crimes, yet if he has lucid intervals and, while he has the use of his
 reason, is contrite and confesses his sins, since he is absolved in the
 sight of God, he must in no way be deprived of the Communion of the Divine
 Sacrament of the Eucharist.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 How those who are possessed may be delivered by the intercessions and prayers
 of the Saints is found in the Legends of the Saints. For by the merits of
 Saints, Martyrs, Confessors and Virgins the unclean spirits are subdued by
 their prayers in the land where they live, just as the Saints in their
 earthly journey subdued them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Likewise we read that the devout prayers of wayfarers have often obtained
 the deliverance of those possessed. And Cassian urges them to pray for them,
 saying: If we hold the opinion or rather faith of which I have written
 above, that everything is sent by the Lord for the good of our souls and the
 betterment of the universe, we shall in no way despise those who are
 possessed; but we shall incessantly pray for them as for our own selves, and
 pity them with our whole heart.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As for the last method, that of releasing the sufferer from excommunication,
 it must be known that this is rare, and only lawfully practised by such as
 have authority and are informed by revelation that the man has become
 possessed on account of the excommunication of the Church: such was the case
 of the Corinthian fornicator (I. <i>Corinthians</i> v) who was excommunicated
 by S. Paul and the Church, and delivered unto Satan for the destruction of
 the flesh, that his spirit might be saved in the day of our Lord JESUS
 Christ; that is, as the gloss says, either for the illumination of grace by
 contrition or for judgement.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And he delivered to Satan false teachers who had lost the faith, such as
 Hymenaeus and Alexander, that they might learn not to blaspheme (I.
 <i>Timothy</i> i). For so great was the power and the grace of S. Paul, says
 the gloss, that by the mere words of his mouth he could deliver to Satan
 those who fell away from the faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 S. Thomas (IV. 18) teaches concerning the three effects of excommunication
 as follows. If a man, he says, is deprived of the prayers of the Church,
 he suffers a threefold loss corresponding with the benefits which accrue
 to one who is in communion with the Church. For those who are excommunicated
 are bereft of the source from which flows an increase of grace to those who
 have it, and a mean to obtain grace for those who have it not; and, being
 deprived of grace, they lose also the power of preserving their uprightness;
 although it must not be thought that they are altogether shut out from God's
 providence, but only from that special providence which watches over the
 sons of the Church; and they lose also a strong source of protection against
 the Enemy, for greater power is granted to the devil to injure such men,
 both bodily and spiritually.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For in the primitive Church, when men had to be drawn into the faith by
 signs, just as the Holy Spirit was made manifest by a visible sign, so also
 a bodily affliction by the devil was the visible sign of a man who was
 excommunicated. And it is not unfitting that a man whose case is not quite
 desperate should be delivered to Satan; for he is not given to the devil as
 one to be damned, but to be corrected, since it is in the power of the
 Church, when she pleases, to deliver him again from the hands of the devil.
 So says S. Thomas. Therefore the lifting of the ban of excommunication, when
 prudently used by a discreet exorcist, is a fitting remedy for those who are
 possessed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But Nider adds that the exorcist must particularly beware of making too
 presumptive a use of his powers, or of mingling any ribaldry or jesting with
 the serious work of God, or adding to it anything that smacks of superstition
 or witchcraft; for otherwise he will hardly escape punishment, as he shows
 by an example.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For Blessed Gregory, in his First Dialogue, tells of a certain woman who,
 against her conscience, yielded to her husband's persuasions to take pare in
 the ceremonies at the vigil of the dedication of the Church of S. Sebastian.
 And because she joined in the Church's procession against her conscience,
 she became possessed and raged publicly. When the priest of that church saw
 this, he took the cloth from the altar and covered her with it; and the
 devil suddenly entered into the priest. And because he had presumed beyond
 his strength, he was constrained by his torments to reveal who he was. So
 says S. Gregory.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And to show that no spirit of ribaldry must
 be allowed to enter into the holy office of exorcism, Nider tells that he
 saw in a monastery at Cologne a brother who was given to speaking jestingly,
 but was a very famous expeller of devils. This man was casting a devil out
 of a man possessed in the monastery, and the devil asked him to give him
 some place to which he could go. This pleased the Brother, and he jokingly
 said, “Go to my privy.” So the devil went out; and when in the
 night the Brother wished to go and purge his belly, the devil attacked him
 so savagely in the privy that he with difficulty escaped with his life.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But especial care is to be taken that those who are obsessed through
 witchcraft should not be induced to go to witches to be healed. For S.
 Gregory goes on to say of the woman we have just mentioned: Her kindred
 and those who loved her in the flesh took her to some witches to be healed,
 by whom she was taken to a river and dipped in the water with many
 incantation; and upon this she was violently shaken, and instead of one
 devil being cast out, a legion entered into her, and she began to cry out in
 their several voices. Therefore her kindred confessed what they had done,
 and in great grief brought her to the holy Bishop
 Fortunatus, who by daily prayers and
 fasting entirely restored her to health.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since it has been said that exorcists must beware lest they make use of
 anything savouring of superstition or witchcraft, some exorcist may doubt
 whether it is lawful to use certain unconsecrated herbs and stones. In answer
 we say that it is so much the better if the herbs are consecrated; but that
 if they are not, then it is not superstitious to use a certain herb called
 Demonifuge, or even the natural properties of
 stones. But he must not think that he is casting out devils by the power of
 these; for then he would fall into the error of believing that he could use
 other herbs and incantations in the same way; and this is the error of
 necromancers, who think that they can perform this kind of work through the
 natural and unknown virtues of such objects.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore S. Thomas says, Book IV. dist. 7, art. the last: It must not be
 any corporeal powers; and therefore they are not to be influenced by
 invocations or any acts of sorcery, except in so far as they have entered
 into a pact with a witch. Of this Esaias (xxviii) speaks: We have made a
 covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement. And he thus explains
 the passage in <i>Job</i> xli: Canst thou draw out Leviathan with an hook?
 and the following words. For he says: If one rightly considers all that has
 been said before, it will seem that it belongs to the heretical presumption
 of necromancers when anyone tries to make an agreement with devils, or to
 subject them in any way to his own will.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Having, then, shown that man cannot of his own power overcome the devil, he
 concludes by saying: Place your hand upon him; but understand that, if you
 have any power, it is yet by Divine virtue that he is overcome. And he adds:
 Remember the battle which I wage against him; that is to say, the present
 being put for the future, I shall fight against him on the Cross, where
 Leviathan will be taken with an hook, that is, by the divinity hidden under
 the bait of humanity, since he will think our Saviour to be only a man. And
 afterwards it says: There is no power on earth to be compared with him: by
 which it is meant that no bodily power can equal the power of the devil,
 which is a purely spiritual power. So says S. Thomas.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But a man possessed by a devil can indirectly be relieved by the power of
 music, as was Saul by David's harp, or of a herb, or of any other bodily
 matter in which there lies some natural virtue. Therefore such remedies may
 be used, as can be argued both from authority and by reason. For S. Thomas,
 XXVI. 7, says that stones and herbs may be used for the relief of a man
 possessed by a devil. And there are the words of S. Jerome.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as for the passage in <i>Tobias</i>, where the Angel says: Touching the
 heart and the liver (which you took from the fish), if a devil or an evil
 spirit trouble any, we must make a smoke thereof before the man or the
 woman, and the party shall be no more vexed; S. Thomas says: We ought not to
 marvel at this, for the smoke of a certain tree when it is burned seems to
 have the same virtue, as if it has in it some spiritual sense, or power of
 spiritual prayer for the future.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Of the same opinion are Blessed Albert, in his commentary on <i>S. Luke</i>
 ix, and Nicolas of Lyra and Paul of Burgos,
 on I. <i>Samuel</i> xvi. The last-named homilist comes to this conclusion:
 that it must be allowed that those possessed by a devil can not only be
 relieved, but even entirely delivered by means of material things,
 understanding that in the latter case they are not very fiercely molested.
 And he proves this by reasoning as follows: Devils cannot alter corporeal
 matter just at their will, but only by bringing together complementary active
 and passive agents, as Nicolas says. In the same way some material object
 can cause in the human body a disposition which makes it susceptible to the
 operations of the devil. For example, according to physicians, mania very
 much predisposes a man to dementia, and consequently to demoniac obsession:
 therefore if, in such a case, the predisposing passive agent be remove, it
 will follow that the active affliction of the devil will be cured.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In this light we may consider the fish's liver; and the music of David, by
 which Saul was at first relieved and then entirely delivered of the evil
 spirit; for it says: And the evil spirit departed from him. But it is not
 consonant with the meaning of the Scripture to say that this was done by
 the merits or prayers of David; for the Scripture says nothing of any such
 matter, whereas it would have spoken notably in his praise if this had been
 so. This reasoning we take fro Paul of Burgos. There is also the reason
 which we gave in Question V of the First Part: that Saul was liberated
 because by the harp was prefigured the virtue of the Cross on which were
 stretched the Sacred Limbs of Christ's Body. And more is written there which
 may be considered together with the present inquiry. But we shall only
 conclude by saying that the use of material things in lawful exorcisms is
 not superstitious. And now it is expedient that we should speak about the
 exorcisms themselves.

<h2>Chapter VI</h2>
<h3>Prescribed Remedies; to wit, the Lawful Exorcisms of the Church, for all Sorts of Infirmities and Ills due to Witchcraft; and the Method of Exorcising those who are Bewitched.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It has already been stated that witches can afflict men with
 every kind of physical infirmity; therefore it can be taken as a
 general rule that the various verbal or practical remedies which
 can be applied in the case of those infirmities which we have
 just been discussing are equally applicable to all other
 infirmities, such as epilepsy or leprosy, for example. And as
 lawful exorcisms are reckoned among the verbal remedies and have
 been most often considered by us, they may be taken as a general
 type of such remedies; and there are three matters to be
 considered regarding them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First, we must judge whether a person who has not been ordained
 as an exorcist, such as a layman or a secular cleric, may
 lawfully exorcise devils and their works. Bound up with this
 question are three others: namely; first, what constitutes the
 legality of this practice; secondly, the seven conditions which
 must be observed when one wishes to make private use of charms
 and benedictions; and thirdly, in what way the disease is to be
 exorcised and the devil conjured.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, we must consider what is to be done when no healing
 grace results from the exorcism.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, we must consider practical and not verbal remedies;
 together with the solution of certain arguments.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the first, we have the opinion of S. Thomas in Book IV, dist.
 23. He says: When a man is ordained as an exorcist, or into any
 of the other minor Orders, he has conferred upon him the power of
 exorcism in his official capacity; and this power may even
 lawfully be used by those who belong to no Order, but such do not
 exercise it in their official capacity. Similarly the Mass can be
 said in an unconsecrated house, although the very purpose of
 consecrating a church is that the Mass may be said there; but
 this is more on account of the grace which is in the righteous
 than of the grace of the Sacrament.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From these words we may conclude that, although it is good that
 in the liberation of a bewitched person recourse should be had to
 an exorcist having authority to exorcise such bewitchments, yet
 at times other devout persons may, either with or without any
 exorcism, cast out this sort of diseases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For we hear of a certain poor and very devout virgin, one of
 whose friends has been grievously bewitched in his foot, so that
 it was clear to the physicians that he could be cured by no
 medicines. But it happened that the virgin went to visit the sick
 man, and he at once begged her to apply some benediction to his
 foot. She consented, and did no more than silently say the Lord's
 Prayer and the Apostles' Creed, at the same time making use of
 the sign of the life-giving Cross. The sick man then felt himself
 at once cured, and, that he might have a remedy for the future,
 asked the virgin what charms she had used. But she answered: You
 are of little faith and do not hold to the holy and lawful
 practices of the Church, and you often apply forbidden charms and
 remedies for your infirmities; therefore you are rarely healthy
 in your body, because you are always sick in your soul. But if
 you would put your trust in prayer and in the efficacy of lawful
 symbols, you will often be very easily cured. For I did nothing
 but repeat the Lord's Prayer and the Apostles' Creed, and you are
 now cured.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This example gives rise to the question, whether there is not any
 efficacy in other benedictions and charms, and even conjurations
 by way of exorcism; for they seem to be condemned in this story.
 We answer that the virgin condemned only unlawful charms and
 unlawful conjurations and exorcisms.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To understand these last we must consider how they originated,
 and how they came to be abused. For they were in their origin
 entirely sacred; but just as by the means of devils and wicked
 men all things can be defiled, so also were these sacred words.
 For it is said in the last chapter of S. Mark, of the Apostles
 and holy men: In My Name shall they cast out devils; and they
 visited the sick, and prayed over them with sacred words; and in
 after times priests devoutly used similar rites; and therefore
 there are to be found to-day in ancient Churches devout prayers
 and holy exorcisms which men can use or undergo, when they are
 applied by pious men as they used to be, without any
 superstition; even as there are now to be found learned men and
 Doctors of holy Theology who visit the sick and use such words
 for the healing not only of demoniacs, but of other diseases as
 well.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But, alas! superstitious men have, on the pattern of these, found
 for themselves many vain and unlawful remedies which they employ
 these days for sick men and animals; and the clergy have become
 too slothful to use any more the lawful words when they visit the
 sick. On this account Gulielmus Durandus,
 the commentator on S. Raymond, says that such lawful exorcisms may be
 used by a religious and discreet priest, or by a layman, or even by a
 woman of good life and proved discretion; by the offering of lawful
 prayers over the sick: not over fruits or animals, but over the
 sick. For the Gospel says: They shall place their hands upon the
 sick, etc. And such persons are not to be prevented from
 practising in this way; unless perhaps it is feared that,
 following their example, other indiscreet and superstitious
 persons should make improper use of incantations. It is these
 superstitious diviners whom that virgin we have mentioned
 condemned, when she said that they who consulted with such had
 weak, that is to say bad, faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now for the elucidation of this matter it is asked how it is
 possible to know whether the words of such charms and
 benedictions are lawful or superstitious, and how they ought to
 be used; and whether the devil can be conjured and diseases
 exorcised.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the first place, that is said to be lawful in the Christian
 religion which is not superstitious; and that is said to be
 superstitious which is over and above the prescribed form of
 religion. See <i>Colossians</i> ii: which things indeed have a
 show of wisdom in superstition: on which the gloss says:
 Superstition is undisciplined religion, that is, religion
 observed with defective methods in evil circumstance.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Anything, also, is superstition which human tradition without
 higher authority has caused to usurp the name of religion; such
 is the interpolation of hymns at Holy Mass, the alteration of the
 Preface for Requiems, the abbreviation of the Creed which it to
 be sung at Mass, the reliance upon an organ rather than upon the
 choir for the music, neglect to have a Server on the Altar, and
 such practices. But to return to our point, when a work is done
 by virtue of the Christian religion, as when someone wishes to
 heal the sick by means of prayer and benediction and sacred
 words, which is the matter we are considering), such a person
 must observe seven conditions by which such benedictions are
 rendered lawful. And even if he uses adjurations, through the
 virtue of the Divine Name, and by the virtue of the works of
 Christ, His Birth, Passion and Precious Death, by which the devil
 was conquered and cast out; such benedictions and charms and
 exorcisms shall be called lawful, and they who practise them are
 exorcists or lawful enchanters. See S. Isidore, <i>Etym</i>.
 VIII, Enchanters are they whose art and skill lies in the use of
 words.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the first of these conditions, as we learn from S. Thomas, is
 that there must be nothing in the words which hints at any
 expressed or tacit invocation of devils. If such were expressed,
 it would be obviously unlawful. If it were tacit, it might be
 considered in the light of intention, or in that of fact: in that
 of intention, when the operator has no care whether it is God or
 the devil who is helping him, so long as he attains his desired
 result; in that of fact, when a person has no natural aptitude
 for such work, but creates some artificial means. And of such not
 only must physicians and astronomers be the judges, but
 especially Theologians. For in this way do necromancers work,
 making images and rings and stones by artificial means; which
 have no natural virtue to effect the results which they very
 often expect: therefore the devil must be concerned in their
 works.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, the benedictions or charms must contain no unknown
 names; for according to S. John Chrysostom such are to be
 regarded with fear, lest they should conceal some matter of
 superstition.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, there must be nothing in the words that is untrue; for
 if there is, the effect of them cannot be from God, Who is not a
 witness to a lie. But some old women in their incantations use
 some such jingling doggerel as the following:<p>

 Blessed MARY went a-walking<br/>
 Over Jordan river.<br/>
 Stephen met her, and fell a-talking, etc.<p>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fourthly, there must be no vanities, or written characters beyond
 the sign of the Cross. Therefore the charms which soldiers are
 wont to carry are condemned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fifthly, no faith must be placed in the method of writing or
 reading or binding the charm about a  person, or in any such
 vanity, which has nothing to do with the reverence of God,
 without which a charm is altogether superstitious.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Sixthly, in the citing and uttering of Divine words and of Holy
 Scripture attention must only be paid to the sacred words
 themselves and their meaning, and to the reverence of God;
 whether the effect be looked for from the Divine virtue, or from
 the relics of Saints, which are a secondary power, since their
 virtue springs originally from God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Seventhly, the looked-for effect must be left tot he Divine Will;
 for He knows whether it is best for a man to be healed or to be
 plagued, or to die. This condition was set down by S. Thomas.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 So we may conclude that if none of these conditions be broken,
 the incantation will be lawful. And S. Thomas writes in this
 connexion on the last chapter of <i>S. Mark: </i>And these signs
 shall follow them that believe; in my name shall they cast out
 devils; they shall take up serpents. From this it is clear that,
 provided the above conditions are observed, it is lawful by means
 of sacred words to keep serpents away.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 S. Thomas says further: The words of God are not less holy than
 the Relics of the Saints. As S. Augustine says: The word of God
 is not less than the Body of Christ. But all are agreed that it
 is lawful to carry reverently about the person the Relics of the
 Saints: therefore let us by all means invoke the name of God by
 duly using the Lord's Prayer and the Angelic Salutation, by His
 Birth and Passion, by His Five Wounds, and by the Seven Words
 which He spoke on the Cross, by the Triumphant Inscription, by
 the three nails, and by the other weapons of Christ's army
 against the devil and his works. By all these means it is lawful
 to work, and our trust may be placed in them, leaving the issue
 to God's will.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And what has been said about the keeping off of serpents applies
 also to other animals, provided that the attention is fixed only
 on the sacred words and the Divine virtue. But great care is to
 be used in incantations of this nature. For S. Thomas says: Such
 diviners often use unlawful observances, and obtain magic effects
 by means of devils, especially in the case of serpents; for the
 serpent was the devil's first instrument by which he deceived
 mankind.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For in the town of Salzburg there was a certain mage who one day,
 in open view of all, wanted to charm all the snakes into a
 particular pit, and kill them all within an area of a mile. So he
 gathered all the snakes together, and was himself standing over
 the pit, when last of all there came a huge and horrible serpent
 which would not go into the pit. This serpent kept making signs
 to the man to let it go away and crawl where it would; but he
 would not cease from his incantation, but insisted that, as all
 the other snakes had entered the pit and there died, so also must
 this horrible serpent. But it stood on the opposite side to the
 warlock, and suddenly leapt over the pit and fell upon the man,
 wrapping itself round his belly, and dragged him with itself into
 the pit, where they both died. From this it may be seen that only
 for a useful purpose, such as driving them away from men's
 houses, are such incantations to be practised, and they are to be
 done by the Divine virtue, and in the fear of God, and with
 reverence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the second place we have to consider how exorcisms or charms
 of this kind ought to be used, and whether they should be worn
 round the neck or sewn into the clothing. It may seem that such
 practices are unlawful; for S. Augustine says, in the <i>Second
 Book on the Christian Doctrine:</i> There are a thousand magic
 devices and amulets and charms which are all superstitious, and
 the School of Medicine utterly condemns them all, whether they
 are incantations, or certain marks which are called characters,
 or engraved charms to be hung round the neck.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also S. John Chrysostom, commenting on <i>S. Matthew</i>, says:
 Some persons wear round their neck some written portion of the
 Gospel; but is not the Gospel every day read in the church and
 heard by all? How then shall a man be helped by wearing the
 Gospel round his neck, when he has reaped no benefit from hearing
 it with his ears? For in what does the virtue of the Gospel
 consist; in the characters of its letters, or in the meaning of
 its words? If in the characters, you do well to hang it round
 your neck; but if in the meaning, surely it is of more benefit
 when planted in the heart than when worn round the neck.<br/>

<h2>Chapter VII</h2>
<h3>Remedies prescribed against Hailstorms, and for animals that are Bewitched.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 With regard to the remedies for betwitched animals, and charms against
 tempests, we must first note some unlawful remedies which are practised by
 certain people. For these are done by means of superstitious words or
 actions; as when men cure the worms in the fingers or limbs by means of
 certain words or charms, the method of
 deciding the legality of which has been explained in the preceding chapter.
 There are others who do not sprinkle Holy Water over bewitched cattle, but
 pour it into their mouths.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Beside the proofs we have already given that the remedy of words is
 unlawful, William of Paris, whom we have often quoted, gives the following
 reason. If there were any virtue in words as words, then it would be due
 to one of three things: either their material, which is air; or their form,
 which is sound; or their meaning; or else to all three together. Now it
 cannot be due to air, which has no power to kill unless it be poisonous;
 neither can it be due to sound, the power of which is broken by a more
 solid object; neither can it be due to the meaning, for in that case the
 words Devil or Death or Hell would always be harmful, and the words Health
 and Goodness always be beneficial. Also it cannot be due to all these three
 together; for when the parts of a whole are invalid, the whole itself is
 also invalid.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it cannot validly be objected that God gave virtue to words just as He
 did to herbs and stones. For whatever virtue there is in certain sacramental
 words and benedictions and lawful incantations belongs to them, not as words,
 but by Divine institution and ordinance according to God's promise. It is,
 as it were, a promise from God that whoever does such and such a thing will
 receive such and such a grace. And so the words of the sacraments are
 effective because of their meaning; although some hold that they have an
 intrinsic virtue; but these two opinions are not mutually inconsistent. But
 the case of other words and incantations is clear from what has already been
 said; for the mere composing or uttering or writing of words, as such, can
 have no effect; but the invocation of the Divine Name, and public prayer,
 which is a sacred protestation committing the effect to the Divine Will, are
 beneficial.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We have treated above of remedies performed by actions which seem to be
 unlawful. The following is a common practice in parts of Swabia. On the first
 of May before sunrise the women of the village go out and gather from the
 woods leaves and branches from willow trees, and weave them into a wreath
 which they hang over the stable door, affirming that all the cattle will then
 remain unhurt and safe from witchcraft for a whole year. And in the opinion
 of those who hold that vanity may be opposed by vanity, this remedy would
 not be unlawful; and neither would be the driving away of diseases by
 unknown cantrips and incantations. But without meaning and offence, we say
 that a woman or anyone else may go out on the first or any other day of the
 month, without considering the rising or the setting of the sun, and collect
 herbs or leaves and branches, saying the Lord's Prayer or the Creed, and
 hang them over the stable door in good faith, trusting to the will of God
 for their protective efficacy; yet even so the practice is not above reproach,
 as was shown in the preceding chapter in the words of S. Jerome; for even if
 he is not invoked, the devil has some part in the efficacy of herbs and
 stones.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is the same with those who make the sign of the Cross with leaves and
 consecrated flowers on Palm Sunday, and set it up among their vines or crops;
 asserting that, although the crops all round should be destroyed by hail,
 yet they will remain unharmed in their own fields. Such matters should be
 decided upon according to the distinction of which we have already treated.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Similarly there are women who, for the preservation of milk and that cows
 should not be deprived of their milk by witchcraft, give freely to the poor
 in God's name the whole of a Sunday's yield of milk; and say that, by this
 sort of alms, the cows yield even more milk and are preserved from
 witchcraft. This need not be regarded as superstitious, provided that it is
 done out of pity for the poor, and that they implore the Divine mercy for
 the protection of their cattle, leaving the effect to the good pleasure of
 Divine providence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, Nider in the First chapter of his <i>Præceptorium</i> says that
 it is lawful to bless cattle, in the same way as sick men, by means of
 written charms and sacred words, even if they have the appearance of
 incantations, as long as the seven conditions we have mentioned are
 observed. For he says that devout persons and virgins have been known to
 sign a cow with the sign of the Cross, together with the Lord's Prayer and
 the Angelic Salutation, upon which the devil's work has been driven off, if
 it is due to witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And in his <i>Formicarius</i> he tells that witches confess that their
 witchcraft is obstructed by the reverent observation of the ceremonies of
 the Church; as by the aspersion of Holy Water, or the consumption of
 consecrated salt, by the lawful use of candles on the Day of Purification
 and of blessed palms, and such things. For this reason the Church uses these
 in her exorcisms, that they may lessen the power of the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also, because when witches wish to deprive a cow of milk they are in the
 habit of begging a little of the milk or butter which comes from that cow,
 so that they may afterwards by their art bewitch the cow; therefore women
 should take care, when they are asked by persons suspected of this crime,
 not to give away the least thing to them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, there are women who, when they have been turning a church for a long
 while to no purpose, and if they suspect that this is due to some witch,
 procure if possible a little butter from the house of that witch. Then they
 make that butter into three pieces and throw them into the churn, invoking
 the Holy Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; and so all
 witchcraft is put to flight. Here again it is a case of opposing vanity to
 vanity, for the simple reason that the butter must be borrowed from the
 suspected witch. But if it were done without this; if with the invocation of
 the Holy Trinity and the Lord's Prayer the woman were to commit the effect
 of the Divine Will, she would remain beyond reproach. Nevertheless it is not
 a commendable practice to throw in the three pieces of butter; for it would
 be better to banish the witchcraft by means of sprinkling Holy Water or
 putting in some exorcised salt, always with the prayers we have mentioned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, since often the whole of a person's cattle are destroyed by witchcraft,
 those who have suffered in this way ought to take care to remove the soil
 under the threshold of the stable or stall, and where the cattle go to
 water, and replace it with fresh soil sprinkled with Holy Water. For witches
 have often confessed that they have placed some instrument of witchcraft at
 the instance of devils, they have only had to make a hole in which the devil
 has placed the instrument of witchcraft; and that this was a visible object,
 such as a stone or a piece of wood or a mouse or some serpent. For it is
 agreed that the devil can perform such things by himself without the need of
 any partner; but usually, for the perdition of her soul, he compels a witch
 to co-operate with him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In addition to the setting up of the sign of the Cross which we have
 mentioned, the following procedure is practised against hailstorms and
 tempests. Three of the hailstones are thrown into the fire with an invocation
 of the Most Holy Trinity, and the Lord's Prayer and the Angelic Salutation
 are repeated twice or three times, together with the Gospel of S. John,
 <i>In the beginning was the Word</i>. And the sign of the Cross is made in
 every direction towards each quarter of the world. Finally, <i>The Word was
 made Flesh</i> is repeated three times, and three times, “By the words
 of this Gospel may this tempest be dispersed.” And suddenly, if the
 tempest is due to witchcraft, it will cease. This is most true and need not
 be regarded with any suspicion. For if the hailstones were thrown into the
 fire without the invocation of the Divine Name, then it would be considered
 superstitious.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be asked whether the tempest could not be stilled without the use
 of those hailstones. We answer that it is the other sacred words that are
 chiefly effective; but by throwing in the hailstones a man means to torment
 the devil, and tries to destroy his works by the invocation of the Holy
 Trinity. And he throws them into the fire rather than into water, because
 the more quickly they are dissolved the sooner is the devil's work destroyed.
 But he must commit to the Divine Will the effect which is hoped for.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Relevant to this is the reply given by a witch to a Judge who asked her if
 there were any means of stilling a tempest raised by witchcraft. She
 answered: Yes, by this means. I adjure you, hailstorms and winds, by the
 five wounds of Christ, and by the three nails which pierced His hands and
 feet, and by the four Holy Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, that
 you be dissolved and fall as rain.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Many also confess, some freely and some under stress of torture, that there
 are five things by which they are much hindered, sometimes entirely,
 sometimes in part, sometimes so that they cannot harm his friends. And
 these are, that a man should have a pure faith and keep the commandments of
 God; that he should protect himself with the sign of the Cross and with
 prayer; that he should reverence the rites and ceremonies of the Church;
 that he should be diligent in the performance of public justice; and that he
 should meditate aloud or in his heart on the Passion of Christ. And of these
 things Nider also speaks. And for this reason it is a general practice of
 the Church to ring bells as a protection against storms, both that the
 devils may flee from them as being consecrated to God and refrain from their
 wickedness, and also that the people may be roused up to invoke God against
 tempests with the Sacrament of the Altar and sacred words, following the
 very ancient custom of the Church in France and Germany.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since this method of carrying out the Sacrament to still a storm seems
 to many a little superstitious, because they do not understand the rules by
 which it is possible to distinguish between that which is superstitious and
 that which is not; therefore it must be considered that five rules are given
 by which anyone may know whether an action is superstitious, that is, outside
 the observances of the Christian religion, or whether it is in accordance
 with the due and proper worship and honour of God, proceeding from the true
 virtue of religion both in the thoughts of the heart and in the actions of
 the body. For these are explained in the gloss on <i>Colossians</i> ii, where
 S. Paul says: Which things have a show of wisdom in superstition; and the
 gloss says: Superstition is religion observed without due discipline; as
 was said before.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The first of these is, that in all our works the glory of God ought to be
 our chief aim; as it is said: Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever else ye
 do, do all in the glory of God. Therefore in
 every work relating to the Christian religion let care be taken that it is
 to the glory of God, and that in it man should give the glory chiefly to
 God, so that by that very work the mind of man may be put in subjection to
 God. And although, according to this rule, the ceremonies and legal
 procedures of the Old Testament are not now observed, since they are to be
 understood figuratively, whereas the truth is made known in the New
 Testament, yet the carrying out of the Sacrament or of Relics to still a
 storm does not seem to militate against this rule.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second rule is that care should be taken that the work is a discipline
 to restrain concupiscence, or a bodily abstinence, but in the way that is
 owed to virtue, that is, according to the rites of the Church and moral
 doctrine. For S. Paul says, <i>Romans</i> xii: Let your service be
 reasonable. And because of this rule, they are foolish who make a vow not
 to comb their hair on the Sabbath, or who fast on Sunday, saying, The better
 the day the better the deed, and such like. But again it does not seem that
 it is superstitious to carry out the Sacrament, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third rule is to be sure that what is done is in accordance with the
 statutes of the Catholic Church, or with the witness of Holy Scripture, or
 according at least to the rites of some particular Church, or in accordance
 with universal use, which S. Augustine says may be taken as a law.
 Accordingly when the Bishops of the English were in doubt because the Mass
 was celebrated in different manners in different Churches, S. Gregory wrote
 to them that they might use whatever methods they found most pleasing to
 God, whether they followed the rites of the Roman or of the Gallican or of
 any other Church. For the fact that different Churches have different
 methods in Divine worship does not militate against the truth, and therefore
 such customs are to be preserved, and it is unlawful to neglect them. And
 so, as we said in the beginning, it is a very ancient custom in the Churches
 of France and some parts of Germany, after the consecration of the Eucharist
 to carry It out into the open; and this cannot be unlawful, provided that It
 is not carried exposed to the air, but enclosed and contained in a Pyx.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The fourth rule is to take care that what is done bears some natural relation
 to the effect which is expected; for if it does not, it is judged to be
 superstitious. On this account unknown characters and suspected names, and
 the images or charts of necromancers and astronomer, are altogether to be
 condemned as suspect. But we cannot say that on this account it is
 superstitious to carry out Holy Relics or the Eucharist as a protection
 against the plagues of the devil; for it is rather a most religious and
 salutary practice, since in that Sacrament lies all our help against the
 Adversary.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The fifth rule is to be careful that what is done should give no occasion
 for scandal or stumbling; for in that case, although it be not superstitious,
 yet because of the scandal it should be forgone or postponed, or done
 secretly without scandal. Therefore if this carrying of the Sacrament can be
 done without scandal, or even secretly, then it should not be neglected. For
 by this rule many secular priests neglect the use of benedictions by means
 of devout words either uttered over the sick or bound round their necks. I
 say that nothing should be done, at least publicly, if it can give any
 occasion of stumbling to other simple folk.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let this be enough on the subject of the remedies against hailstorms, either
 by words or lawful actions.

<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>
<h3>Certain Remedies prescribed against those Dark and Horrid Harms with which Devils may Afflict Men.</h3></div>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Yet again we reserve our judgement in discussing the remedies against
  certain injuries to the fruits of the earth, which are caused by
  canker-worms, or by huge flights of locusts and other insects which cover
  vast areas of land, and seem to hide the surface of the ground, eating up
  everything to the very roots in the vineyards and devouring fields of ripe
  crops. In the same light too we consider the remedies against the stealing
  of children by the work of devils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But with regard to the former kind of injury we may quote S. Thomas, the
  <i>Second of the Second</i>, Question 90, where he asks whether it is
  lawful to adjure an irrational creature. He answers that it is; but only in
  the way of compulsion, by which it is sent back to the devil, who uses
  irrational creatures to harm us. And such is the method of adjuration in the
  exorcisms of the Church by which the power of the devil is kept away from
  irrational creatures. But if the adjuration is addressed to the irrational
  creature itself, which understands nothing, then it would be nugatory and
  vain. From this it can be understood that they can be driven off by lawful
  exorcisms and adjurations, the help of the Divine mercy being granted; but
  first the people should be bidden to fast and to go in procession and
  practice other devotions. For this sort of evil is sent on account of
  adulteries and the multiplication of crimes; wherefore men must be urged to
  confess their sins.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In some provinces even solemn excommunications are pronounced; but then
  they obtain power of adjuration over devils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Another terrible thing which God permits to happen to men is when their
  own children are taken away from women, and strange children are put in
  their place by devils. And these children, which are commonly called
  changelings, or in the German tongue <i>Wechselkinder</i>, are of three
  kinds. For some are always ailing and crying, and yet the milk of four
  women is not enough to satisfy them. Some are generated by the operation of
  Incubus devils, of whom, however, they are not the sons, but of that man
  from whom the devil has received the semen as a Succubus, or whose semen he
  has collected from some nocturnal pollution in sleep. For these children
  are sometimes, by Divine permission, substituted for the real children.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And there is a third kind, when the devils at times appear in the form of
  young children and attach themselves to the nurses. But all three kinds
  have this in common, that though they are very heavy, they are always
  ailing and do not grow, and cannot receive enough milk to satisfy them, and
  are often reported to have vanished away.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it can be said that the Divine pity permits such things for two
  reasons. First, when the parents dote upon their children too much, and
  this a punishment for their own good. Secondly, it is to be presumed that
  the women to whom such things happen are very superstitious, and are in
  many other ways seduced by devils. But God is truly jealous in the right
  sense of the word, which means a strong love for a man's own wife, which
  not only does not allow another man to approach her, but like a jealous
  husband will not suffer the hint or suspicion of adultery. In the same way
  is God jealous of the soul which He bought with His Precious Blood and
  espoused in the Faith; and cannot suffer it to be touched by, to converse
  with, or in any way to approach or have dealings with the devil, the enemy
  and adversary of salvation. And if a jealous husband cannot suffer even a
  hint of adultery, how much more will he be disturbed when adultery is
  actually committed! Therefore it is no wonder if their own children are
  taken away and adulterous children substituted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And indeed that it may be more strongly impressed how God is jealous of
  the soul, and will not suffer anything which might cause a suspicion, it is
  shown in the Old Law where, that He might drive His people farther from
  idolatry, He not only forbade idolatry, but also many other things which
  might give occasion to idolatry, and seemed to have no use in themselves,
  although in some marvellous way they retain some use in a mystical sense.
  For He not only says in <i>Exodus</i> xxii: Thou shalt not suffer a witch
  to live on this earth; but He adds this: She shall not dwell in thy land,
  lest perchance she cause thee to sin. Similarly common bawds and bulkers
  are put to death, and not allowed to company with men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Note the jealousy of God, Who says as follows in <i>Deuteronomy</i> xxii:
  If thou find a bird's nest, and the dam sitting upon the eggs or upon the
  young ones, thou shalt not take the dam with the young, but thou shalt let
  the dam fly away; because the Gentiles used these to procure sterility. The
  jealous God would not suffer in His people this sign of adultery. In like
  manner in our days when old women find a penny, they think it a sign of
  great fortune; and conversely, when they dream of money it is an unlucky
  sign. Also God taught that all vessels should be covered, and that when a
  vessel had no cover it should be considered unclean.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There was an erroneous belief that when devils came in the night (or the
  Good People as old women call them, though they are witches, or devils in
  their forms) they must eat up everything, that afterwards they may bring
  greater abundance of stores. Some people give colour to the story, and call
  them Screech Owls; but this is against the opinion of the Doctors, who say
  that there are no rational creatures except men and Angels; therefore they
  can only be devils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, in <i>Leviticus</i> xix: Ye shall not round the corners of your
  heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard; because they did
  this idolatrously in veneration of idols.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again in <i>Deuteronomy</i> xxii: God says that men shall not put on the
  garments of women, or conversely; because they did this in honour of the
  goddess Venus, and others in honour of Mars or Priapus.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And for the same reason He commanded the altars of idols to be destroyed;
  and Hezechias destroyed the Brazen Serpent when the people wanted to
  sacrifice to it, saying: It is brass. For the same reason He forbade the
  observance of visions and auguries, and commanded that the man or woman in
  whom there was a familiar spirit should be put to death. Such are now
  called soothsayers. All these things, because they give rise to suspicion
  of spiritual adultery, therefore, as has been said, from the jealousy which
  God has for the souls He has espoused, as a husband espouses a wife, they
  were all forbidden by Him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And so we preachers also ought to bear in mind that no sacrifice is more
  acceptable to God than a jealousy of souls, as S. Jerome says in his
  commentaries upon Ezekiel.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore in the Third Part of this work we shall treat the extermination
  of witches, which is the ultimate remedy. For this is the last recourse of
  the Church, to which she is bound by Divine commandment. For it has been
  said: Ye shall not suffer witches to live upon the earth. And with this
  will be included the remedies against archer-wizards; since this kind can
  only be exterminated by secular law.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A remedy. When certain persons for the sake of temporal gain have devoted
  themselves entirely to the devil, it has often been found that, though they
  may be freed from the devil's power by true confession, yet they have been
  long and grievously tormented, especially in the night. And God allows this
  for their punishment. But a sign that they have been delivered is that,
  after confession, all the money in their purses or coffers vanishes. Many
  examples of this could be adduced, but for the sake of brevity they are
  passed over and omitted.<br/>

<h2>General and Introductory</h2>
<h3>Who are the Fit and Proper Judges in the Trial of Witches?</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The question is whether witches, together with their patrons and protectors
 and defenders, are so entirely subject to the jurisdiction of the Diocesan
 Ecclesiastical Court and the Civil Court so that the Inquisitors of the
 crime of heresy can be altogether relieved from the duty of sitting in
 judgement upon them. And it is argued that this is so. For the Canon (c.
 <i>accusatus</i>, § <i>sane</i>, lib. VI) says: Certainly those whose
 high privilege it is to judge concerning matters of the faith ought not to
 be distracted by other business; and Inquisitors deputed by the Apostolic
 See to inquire into the pest of heresy should manifestly not have to concern
 themselves with diviners and soothsayers, unless these are also heretics,
 nor should it be their business to punish such, but they may leave them to
 be punished by their own judges.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Nor does there seem any difficulty in the fact that the heresy of witches is
 not mentioned in that Canon. For these are subject to the same punishment
 as the others in the court of conscience, as the Canon goes on to say (dist.
 I, <i>pro dilectione</i>). If the sin of diviners and witches is secret, a
 penance of forty days shall be imposed upon them: if it is notorious, they
 shall be refused the Eucharist. And those whose punishment is identical
 should receive it from the same Court. Then, again, the guilt of both being
 the same, since just as soothsayers obtain their results by curious means,
 so do witches look for and obtain from the devil the injuries which they do
 to creatures, unlawfully seeking from His creatures that which should be
 sought from God alone; therefore both are guilty of the sin of idolatry.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This is the sense of <i>Ezechiel</i> xxi, 23; that the King of Babylon stood
 at the cross-roads, shuffling his arrows and
 interrogating idols.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again it may be said that, when the Canon says “Unless these are also
 heretics,” it allows that some diviners and soothsayers are heretics,
 and should therefore be subject to trial by the Inquisitors; but in that
 case artificial diviners would also be so subject, and no written authority
 for that can be found.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, if witches are to be tried by the Inquisitors, it must be for the
 crime of heresy; but it is clear that the deeds of witches can be committed
 without any heresy. For when they stamp into the mud of the Body of Christ,
 although this is a most horrible crime, yet it may be done without any
 error in the understanding, and therefore without heresy. For it is
 entirely possible for a person to believe that It is the Lord's body, and
 yet throw It into the mud to satisfy the devil, and this by reason of some
 pact with him, that he may obtain some desired end, such as the finding of
 a treasure or anything of that sort. Therefore the deeds of witches need
 involved no error in faith, however great the sin may be; in which case they
 are not liable to the Court of the Inquisition, but are left to their own
 judges.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, Solomon showed reverence to the gods of his wives out of complaisance,
 and was not on that account guilty of apostasy from the Faith; for in his
 heart he was faithful and kept the true Faith. So also when witches give
 homage to devils by reason of the pact they have entered into, but keep the
 Faith in their hearts, they are not on that account to be reckoned as
 heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be said that all witches have to deny the Faith, and therefore
 must be judged heretics. On the contrary, even if they were to deny the
 Faith in their hearts and minds, still they could not be reckoned as
 heretics, but as apostates. But a heretic is different from an apostate,
 and it is heretics who are subject to the Court of the Inquisition; therefore
 witches are not so subject.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again it is said, in c. 26, quest. 5: Let the Bishops and their
 representatives strive by every means to rid their parishes entirely of the
 pernicious art of soothsaying and magic derived from Zoroaster; and if they
 find any man or woman addicted to this crime, let him be shamefully cast out
 of their parishes in disgrace. So when it says at the end of c. 348, Let
 them leave them to their own Judges; and since it speaks in the plural,
 both of the Ecclesiastic and the Civil Court; therefore, according to this
 Canon they are subject to no more than the Diocesan Court.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if, just as these arguments seem to show it to be reasonable in the
 case of Inquisitors, the Diocesans also wish to be relieved of this
 responsibility, and to leave the punishment of witches to the secular
 Courts, such a claim could be made good by the following arguments. For the
 Canon says, c. <i>ut inquisitionis:</i> We strictly forbid the temporal
 lords and rulers and their officers in any way to try to judge this crime,
 since it is purely an ecclesiastical matter: and it speaks of the crime of
 heresy. It follows therefore that, when the crime is not purely ecclesiastical,
 as is the case with witches because of the temporal injuries which they
 commit, it must be punished by the Civil and not by the Ecclesiastical Court.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, in the last Canon Law concerning Jews it says: His goods are to be
 confiscated, and he is to be condemned to death, because with perverse
 doctrine he opposed the Faith of Christ. But if it is said that this law
 refers to Jews who have been converted, and have afterwards returned to the
 worship of the Jews, this is not a valid objection. Rather is the argument
 strengthened by it; because the civil Judge has to punish such Jews as
 apostates from the Faith; and therefore witches who abjure the Faith ought
 to be treated in the same way; for abjuration of the Faith, either wholly or
 in part, is the essential principle of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And although it says that apostasy and heresy are to be judged in the same
 way, yet it is not the part of the ecclesiastical but of the civil Judge to
 concern himself with witches. For no one must cause a commotion among the
 people by reason of a trial for heresy; but the Governor himself must make
 provision for such cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The <i>Authentics</i> of Justinian, speaking of ruling princes, says: You
 shall not permit anyone to stir up your Province by reason of a judicial
 inquiry into matters concerning religions or heresies, or in any way allow
 an injunction to be put upon the Province over which you govern; but you
 shall yourself provide, making use of such monies and other means of
 investigation as are competent, and not allow anything to be done in matters
 of religion except in accordance with our precepts. It is clear from this
 that no one must meddle with a rebellion against the Faith except the
 Governor himself.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Besides, if the trial and punishment of such witches were not entirely a
 matter for the civil Judge, what would be the purpose of the laws which
 provide as follows? All those who are commonly called witches are to be
 condemned to death. And again: Those who harm innocent lives by magic arts
 are to be thrown to the beasts. Again, it is laid down that thy are to be
 subjected to questions and tortures; and that none of the faithful are to
 associate with them, under pain of exile and the confiscation of all their
 goods. And many other penalties are added, which anyone may read in those
 laws.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But in contradiction of all these arguments, the truth of the matter is
 that such witches may be tried and punished conjointly by the Civil and the
 Ecclesiastical Courts. For a canonical crime must be tried by the Governor
 and the Metropolitan of the Province; not by the Metropolitan alone, but
 together with the Governor. This is clear in the <i>Authentics</i>, where
 ruling princes are enjoined as follows: If it is a canonical matter which is
 to be tried, you shall inquire into it together with the Metropolitan of the
 Province. And to remove all doubt on this subject, the gloss says: If it is
 a simple matter of the observance of the faith, the Governor alone may try
 it; but if the matter is more complicated, then it must be tried by a
 Bishop and the Governor; and the matter must be kept within decent limits
 by someone who has found favour with God, who shall protect the orthodox
 faith, and impose suitable indemnities of money, and keep our subjects
 inviolate, that is, shall not corrupt the faith in them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And again, although a secular prince may impose the capital sentence, yet
 this does not exclude the judgement of the Church, whose part it is to try
 and judge the case. Indeed this is perfectly clear from the Canon Law in the
 chapters <i>de summa trin.</i> and <i>fid. cath.</i>, and again in the Law
 concerning heresy, c. <i>ad abolendam</i> and c. <i>urgentis</i> and c.
 <i>excommunicamus</i>, 1 and 2. For the same penalties are provided by both
 the Civil and the Canon Laws, as is shown by the Canon Laws concerning the
 Manichaean and Arian heresies. Therefore the
 punishment of witches belongs to both Courts together, and not to one
 separately.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, the laws decree that clerics shall be corrected by their own Judges,
 and not by the temporal or secular Courts, because their crimes are
 considered to be purely ecclesiastical. But the crime of witches is partly
 civil and partly ecclesiastical, because they commit temporal harm and
 violate the faith; therefore it belongs to the Judges of both Courts to try,
 sentence, and punish them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This opinion is substantiated by the <i>Authentics</i>, where it is said:
 If it is an ecclesiastical crime needing ecclesiastical punishment and fine,
 it shall be tried by a Bishop who stands in favour with God, and not even
 the most illustrious Judges of the Province shall have a hand in it. And we
 do not wish the civil Judges to have any knowledge of such proceedings; for
 such matters must be examined ecclesiastically and the souls of the offenders
 must be corrected by ecclesiastical penalties, according to the sacred and
 divine rules which our laws worthily follow. So it is said. Therefore it
 follows that on the other hand a crime which is of a mixed nature must be
 tried and punished by both courts.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We make our answer to all the above as follows. Our main object here is to
 show how, with God's pleasure, we Inquisitors of Upper Germany may be
 relieved of the duty of trying witches, and leave them to be punished by
 their own provincial Judges; and this because of the arduousness of the work:
 provided always that such a course shall in no way endanger the preservation
 of the faith and the salvation of souls. And therefore we engaged upon this
 work, that we might leave to the Judges themselves the methods of trying,
 judging and sentencing in such cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore in order to show that the Bishops can in many cases proceed against
 witches without the Inquisitors; although they cannot so proceed without the
 temporal and civil Judges in cases involving capital punishment; it is
 expedient that we set down the opinions of certain other Inquisitors in
 parts of Spain, and (saving always the reverence due to them), since we all
 belong to one and the same Order of Preachers, to refute them, so that each
 detail may be more clearly understood.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Their opinion is, then, that all witches, diviners, necromancers, and in
 short all who practise any kind of divination, if they have once embraced
 and professed the Holy Faith, are liable to the Inquisitorial Court, as in
 the three cases noted in the beginning of the chapter, <i>Multorum querela</i>,
 in the decretals of Pope Clement concerning
 heresy; in which it says that neither must the Inquisitor proceed without
 the Bishop, nor the Bishop without the Inquisitor: although there are five
 other cases in which one may proceed without the other, as anyone who reads
 the chapter may see. But in one case it is definitively stated that one must
 not proceed without the other, and that is when the above diviners are to
 be considered as heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the same category they place blasphemers, and those who in any way invoke
 devils, and those who are excommunicated and have contumaciously remained
 under the ban of excommunication for a whole year, either because of some
 matter concerning faith or, in certain circumstances, not on account of the
 faith; and they further include several other such offences. And by reason
 of this the authority of the Ordinary is weakened, since so many more
 burdens are placed upon us Inquisitors which we cannot safely bear in the
 sight of the terrible Judge who will demand from us a strict account of the
 duties imposed upon us.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And because their opinion cannot be refuted unless the fundamental thesis
 upon which  it is founded is proved unsound, it is to be noted that it is
 based upon the commentators on the Canon, especially on the chapter
 <i>accusatus</i>, and § <i>sane</i>, and on the words “savour
 of heresy.” Also they rely upon the sayings of the Theologians, S.
 Thomas, Blessed Albert, and S. Bonaventura, in the <i>Second Book of
 Sentences</i>, dist. 7.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is best to consider some of these in detail. For when the Canon says, as
 was shown in the first argument, that the Inquisitors or heresy should not
 concern themselves with soothsayers and diviners unless they manifestly
 savour of heresy, they say that soothsayers and diviners are of two sorts,
 either artificial or heretical. And the first sort are called diviners pure
 and simple, since they work merely by art; and such are referred to in the
 chapter <i>de sortilegiis</i>, where it says that the presbyter Udalricus
 went to a secret place with a certain infamous person, that is, a diviner,
 says the gloss, not with the intention of invoking the devil, which would
 have been heresy, but that, by inspecting the astrolabe, he might find out
 some hidden thing. And this, they say, is pure divination or sortilege.

<h2>Question I</h2>
<h3>The Method of Initiating a Process</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The first question, then, is what is the suitable method of instituting
 a process on behalf of the faith against witches. In answer to this it must
 be said that there are three methods allowed by Canon Law. The first is
 when someone accuses a person before a judge of the crime of heresy, or of
 protecting heretics, offering to prove it, and to submit himself to the
 penalty of talion if he fails to prove it. The second method is when someone
 denounces a person, but does not offer to prove it and is not willing to
 embroil himself in the matter; but says that he lays information out of zeal
 for the faith, or because of a sentence of excommunication inflicted by the
 Ordinary or his Vicar; or because of the temporal punishment exacted by the
 secular Judge upon those who fail to lay information.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third method involves an inquisition, that is, when there is no accuser
 or informer, but a general report that there are witches in some town or
 place; and then the Judge must proceed, not at the instance of any party,
 but simply by the virtue of his office.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be noted that a judge should not readily admit the first
 method of procedure. For one thing, it is not actuated by motives of faith,
 nor is it very applicable to the case of witches, since they commit their
 deeds in secret. Then, again, it is full of danger to the accuser, because
 of the penalty of talion which he will incur if he fails to prove his case.
 Then, again, it is very litigious.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let the process begin with a general citation affixed to the walls of the
 Parish Church or the Town Hall, in the following manner.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 WHEREAS we, the Vicar of such and such Ordinary (or the Judge of such and
 such county), do endeavour with all our might and strive with our whole
 heart to preserve the Christian people entrusted to us in unity and the
 happiness of the Catholic faith and to keep them far removed from every
 plague of abominable heresy: Therefore we the aforesaid Judge to whose office
 it belongs, to the glory and honour of the worshipful name of JESUS Christ
 and for the exaltation of the Holy Orthodox Faith, and for the putting down
 of the abomination of heresy, especially in all witches in general and in
 each one severally of whatever condition or estate: (Here, if he is an
 ecclesiastical Judge, let him add a summons to all priests and dignitaries
 of the Church in that town and for a distance of two miles about it, who
 have knowledge of this notice. And he shall add) By the authority which we
 exercise in this district, and in virtue of holy obedience and under pain
 of excommunication, we direct, command, require, and admonish that within
 the space of twelve days (Here the secular Judge shall command in his own
 manner under pain of penalties suitable to his office), the first four of
 which shall stand for the first warning, the second for the second, and the
 third for the third warning; and we give this treble canonical warning that
 if anyone know, see, or have heard that any person is reported to be a
 heretic or a witch, or of any is suspected especially of such practices as
 cause injury to men, cattle, or the fruits of the earth, to the loss of the
 State. But if any do not obey these aforesaid commands and admonitions by
 revealing such matters within the term fixed, let him know (Here the
 ecclesiastical Judge shall add) that he is cut off by the sword of
 excommunication (The secular Judge shall add the temporal punishments).
 Which sentence of excommunication we impose as from this time by this writing
 upon all and several who thus stubbornly set at naught these our canonical
 warnings aforesaid, and our requirement of their obedience, reserving to
 ourselves alone the absolution of such sentence (The secular Judge shall
 conclude in this manner). Given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Note also that in the case of the second method the following caution should
 be observed. For it has been said that the second method of procedure and of
 instituting a process on behalf of the faith is by means of an information,
 where the informer does not offer to prove his statement and is not ready
 to be embroiled in the case, but only speaks because of a sentence of
 excommunication, or out of zeal for the faith and for the good of the State.
 Therefore the secular Judge must specify in his general citation or warning
 aforesaid, that none should think that he will become liable to a penalty
 even if he fails to proved his words; since he comes forward not as an
 accuser but as an informer.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And then, since several will appear to lay information before the Judge,
 he ought to take care to proceed in the following manner. First, let him
 have a Notary and two honest persons, either clerics or laymen; or if a
 Notary is not to be procured, then let there be two suitable men in the
 place of the Notary. For this is dealt with in the c. <i>ut officium</i>,
 § <i>uerum</i>, lib. 6, where it is said: But because it is expedient
 to proceed with great caution in the trial of a grave crime, that no error
 may be committed in imposing upon the guilty a deservedly severe punishment;
 we desire and command that, in the examination of the witnesses necessary
 in such a charge, you shall have two religious and discreet persons, either
 clerics or laymen.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It goes on to say: In the presence of these persons the depositions of the
 witnesses shall be faithfully written down by a public official if one is
 obtainable, or, if not, by two suitable men. Note therefore that, having
 these persons, the Judge shall order the informer to lay his information
 in writing, or at least give it clearly by word of mouth. And then the
 Notary or the Judge shall begin to process in the following manner.

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the year of Our Lord —, on the — day of the — month, in
 the presence of me the Notary and of the witnesses subscribed, N. of the
 town of — in the Diocese of —, as above, appeared in the person
 at — before the honourable Judge, and offered him a schedule to the
 following effect.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 (Here shall follow the schedule in its entirety. But if he has not deposed
 in writing buy by word of mouth, it shall continue thus.)<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 He appeared, etc. and laid information to the Judge that N. of the town or
 parish of — in the Diocese of — had said and asserted that he
 knew how to perform or had actually done certain injuries to the deponent
 or to other persons.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 After this, he shall immediately make the deponent take the oath in the
 usual manner, either on the four Gospels of God, or on the Cross, raising
 three fingers and depressing two in witness of the Holy Trinity and of the
 damnation of his soul and body, that he will speak the truth in his
 depositions. And when the oath has been sworn, he shall question him as to
 how he knows that his depositions are true, and whether he saw or heard
 that to which he swears. And if he says that he has seen anything, as, for
 example, that the accused was present at such a time of tempest, or that he
 had touched an animal, or had entered a stable, the Judge shall ask when he
 saw him, and where, and how often, and in what manner, and who were present.
 If he says that he did not see it, but heard of it, he shall ask him from
 whom he heart it, where, when, and how often, and in whose presence, making
 separate articles of each of the several points above mentioned. And the
 Notary or scribe shall set down a record of them immediately after the
 aforesaid denunciation; and it shall continue thus:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This denunciation, as we have said, having been made, the Inquisitor himself
 did at once cause him to swear as above on the four Gospels, etc. that he
 was speaking the truth in his depositions, and did ask him how and why he
 knew or suspected that he what he said was true. He did make answer either
 that he saw, or that he heard. The Inquisitor did then ask him where he saw
 or heard this; and he answered on the — day of the — month in
 the year — in the town or parish of —. He asked him how often he
 saw or heard it, etc. And separate articles shall be made, and the whole set
 down in process, as has been said. And particularly he shall be asked who
 shared or could share in his knowledge of the case.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 When all this has been done, he shall finally be asked whether he lays his
 information out of ill-will, hatred, or rancour; or if he has omitted
 anything through favour or love; of if he has been requested or suborned to
 lay information.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Finally, he shall be enjoined, by virtue of his oath, to keep secret
 whatever he has said there, or whatever the Judge has said to him; and the
 whole process shall be set down in writing. And when all this is completed,
 it shall be set down a little lower as follows. This was done at such a
 place on the — day of the — month in the year —, in the
 presence of me the Notary or scribe together with those associated with me
 in the duty of writing, and of such and such witnesses summoned and
 interrogated.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third method of beginning a process is the commonest and most usual one,
 because it is secret, and no accuser or informer has to appear. But when
 there is a general report of witchcraft in some town or parish, because of
 this report the Judge may proceed without a general citation or admonition
 as above, since the noise of that report comes often to his ears; and then
 again he can begin a process in the presence of the persons, as we have said
 before.

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the year of Our Lord —, on the — day of the — month,
 to the ears of such and such official or judge there came a persistent
 public report and rumour that N. of the town or parish of — did or
 said such and such a thing savouring of witchcraft, against the faith and
 the common good of the State.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the whole shall be set down according to the common report. And a little
 lower:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The case was heard on the — day of the — month in the year
 —, in the presence of me the Notary of such and such authority, or of
 such and such a scribe, and of such and such witnesses who were called and
 interrogated.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But before we proceed to the second Head, which deals with the method of
 conducting this sort of process, we must first say something of the witnesses
 who are to be examined, as to how many they should be, and what should be
 their condition.

<h2>Question II</h2>
<h3>Of the Number of Witnesses</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Since we have said that in the second method the evidence of the witnesses
 is to be written down, it is necessary to know how many witnesses there
 should be, and of what condition. The question is whether a Judge may
 lawfully convict any person of the heresy of witchcraft on the evidence of
 two legitimate witnesses whose evidence is entirely concordant, or whether
 more than two are necessary. And we say that the evidence of witnesses is
 not entirely concordant when it is only partially so; that is, when two
 witnesses differ in their accounts, but agree in the substance or effect: as
 when one says “She bewitched my cow,” and the other says,
 “She bewitched my child,” but they agree as to the fact of
 witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But here we are concerned with the case of two witnesses being in entire,
 not partial, agreement. And the answer is that, although two witnesses seem
 to be enough to satisfy the rigour of law (for the rule is that that which
 is sworn to by two or three is taken for the truth); yet in a charge of this
 kind two witnesses do not seem sufficient to ensure an equitable judgement,
 on account of the heinousness of the crime in question. For the proof of an
 accusation ought to be clearer than daylight; and especially ought this to
 be so in the case of the grave charge of heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be said that very little proof is required in a charge of this
 nature, since it takes very little argument to expose a person's guilt; for
 it is said in the Canon <i>de Haereticis</i>, lib. II, that a man makes
 himself a heretic if in the least of his opinions he wanders from the
 teaching and the path of the Catholic religion. We answer that this is true
 enough with reference to the presumption that a person is a heretic, but not
 as regards a condemnation. For in a charge of this sort the usual order of
 judicial procedure is cut short, since the defendant does not see the
 witnesses take the oath, nor are they made known to him, because this might
 expose them to grave danger; therefore, according to the statute, the
 prisoner is not permitted to know who are his accusers. But the Judge himself
 must by virtue of his office, inquire into any personal enmity felt by the
 witnesses towards the prisoner; and such witnesses cannot be allowed, as
 will be shown later. And when the witnesses give confused evidence on account
 of something lying on their conscience, the Judge is empowered to put them
 through a second interrogatory. For the less opportunity the prisoner has to
 defend himself, the more carefully and diligently should the Judge conduct
 his inquiry.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore, although there are two legitimate and concordant witnesses
 against a person, even so I do not allow that this would be sufficient
 warrant for a Judge to condemn a person on so great a charge; but if the
 prisoner is the subject of an evil report, a period should be set for his
 purgation; and if he is under strong suspicion on account of the evidence
 of two witnesses, the Judge should make him abjure the heresy, or question
 him, or defer his sentence. For it does not seem just to condemn a man of
 good name on so great a charge on the evidence of only two witnesses, though
 the case is otherwise with a person of bad reputation. This matter is fully
 dealt with in the Canon Law of heretics, where it is set down that the
 Bishop shall cause three or more men of good standing to give evidence on
 oath to speak the truth as to whether they have any knowledge of the
 existence of heretics in such a parish.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again it may be asked whether the Judge can justly condemn a person of such
 heresy only on the evidence of witnesses who in some respects differ in
 their evidence, or merely on the strength of a general accusation. We
 answer that he cannot do so on either of the above grounds. Especially since
 the proofs of a charge ought, as we have said, to be clearer than daylight;
 and in this particular charge no one is to be condemned on merely presumptive
 evidence. Therefore in the case of a prisoner who is the subject of a general
 accusation, a period of purgation shall be set for him; and in the case of
 one who is under strong suspicion arising from the evidence of witnesses,
 he shall be made to abjure his heresy. But when, in spite of certain
 discrepancies, the witnesses agree in the main facts, then the matter shall
 rest with the Judge's discretion; and indirectly the question arises how
 often the witnesses can be examined.

<h2>Question III</h2>
<h3>Of the Solemn Adjuration and Re-examination of Witnesses</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be asked whether the Judge can compel witnesses to sweat an oath
 to tell the truth in a case concerning the Faith or witches, of if he can
 examine them many times. We answer that he can do so, especially an
 ecclesiastical Judge, and that in ecclesiastical cases witnesses can be
 compelled to speak the truth, and this on oath, since otherwise their
 evidence would not be valid. For the Canon Law says: The Archbishop or
 Bishop may make a circuit of the parish in which it is rumoured that there
 are heretics, and compel three or more men of good repute, or even, if it
 seems good to him, the whole neighbourhood, to give evidence. And if any
 through damnable obstinacy stubbornly refuse to take the oath, they shall
 on that account be considered as heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And that the witnesses can be examined several times is shown by the Canon,
 where it says that, when the witnesses have given their evidence in a
 confused manner, or appear to have withheld part of their knowledge for
 some reason, the Judge must take care to examine them afresh; for he may
 legally do so.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question IV</h2>
<h3>Of the Quality and Condition of Witnesses</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Note that persons under a sentence of excommunication, associates and
 accomplices in the crime, notorious evildoers and criminals, or servants
 giving evidence against their masters, are admitted as witnesses in a case
 concerning the Faith. And just as a heretic may give evidence against a
 heretic, so may a witch against a witch; but this only in default of other
 proofs, and such evidence can only be admitted for the prosecution and not
 for the defence: this is true also of the evidence of the prisoner's wife,
 sons and kindred; for the evidence of such has more weight in proving a
 charge than in disproving it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This is made clear in the c. <i>in fidei de haer.</i>, where it says: As a
 protection of the faith we allow that in a case of inquiry into the sin of
 heresy, persons under excommunication and partners and accomplices in the
 crime shall be admitted as witnesses, in default of other proofs against
 heretics and their patrons, protectors and defenders; provided that it
 appears probably both from the number of the witnesses and of those against
 whom they give evidence, and from other cicumstances, that they are not
 giving false testimony.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The case of evidence given by perjurers, when it is presumed that they are
 speaking out of zeal for the faith, is deal with in the Canon c. <i>accusatus</i>,
 § <i>licet</i>, where it says that the evidence of perjurers, after
 they have repented, is admissable; and it goes on to say: If it manifestly
 appears that they do not speak in a spirit of levity, or from motives of
 enmity, or by reason of a bribe, but purely out of zeal for the orthodox
 faith, wishing to correct what they have said, or to reveal something about
 which they had kept silence, in defence of the faith, their testimony
 shell be as valid as that of anyone else, provided that there is no other
 obection to it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is clear from the same chapter of the Canon that the testimony of
 men or low repute and criminals, and of servants against their masters, is
 admitted; for it says: So great is the plague of heresy that, in an action
 involving this crime, even servants are admitted as witnesses against their
 masters, and any criminal evildoer may give evidence against any person
 soever.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question V</h2>
<h3>Whether Mortal Enemies may be Admitted as Witnesses</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if it is asked whether the Judge can admit the mortal enemies of the
 prisoner to give evidence  against him in such a case, we answer that he
 cannot; for the same chapter of the Canon says: You must not understand that
 in this kind of charge a mortal personal enemy may be admitted to give
 evidence. Henry of Segusio also makes this quite clear. But it is mortal
 enemies that are spoken of; and it is to be noted that a witness is not
 necessarily to be disqualified because of every sort of enmity. And a mortal
 enmity is constituted by the following circumstances: when there is a death
 feud or vendetta between the parties, or when there has been an attempted
 homicide, or some serious wound or injury which manifestly shows that there
 is mortal hatred on the part of the witness against the prisoner, And in
 such a case it is presumed that, just as the witness has tried to inflict
 temporal death on the prisoner by wounding him, so he will also be willing
 to effect his object by accusing him of heresy; and just as he wished to
 take away his life, so he would be willing to take away his good name.
 Therefore the evidence of such mortal enemies is justly disqualified.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there are other serious degrees of enmity (for women are easily provoked
 to hatred), which need not totally disqualify a witness, although they
 render his evidence very doubtful, so that full credence cannot be placed in
 his words unless they are substantiated by independent proofs, and other
 witnesses supply an indubitable proof of them. For the Judge must ask the
 prisoner whether he thinks that he has any enemy who would dare to accuse
 him of that crime out of hatred, so that he might compass his death; and if
 he says that he has, he shall ask who that person is; and then the Judge
 shall take note whether the person named as being likely to give evidence
 from motives of malice has actually done so. And if it is found that this
 is the case, and the Judge has learned from trustworthy men the cause of
 that enmity, and if the evidence in question is not substantiated by other
 proofs and the words of other witnesses, then he may safely reject such
 evidence. But if the prisoner says that he hopes he has no such enemy, but
 admits that he has had quarrels with women; or if he says that he has an
 enemy, but names someone who, perhaps, has not given evidence, in that case,
 even if other witnesses say that such a person has given evidence from
 motives of enmity, the Judge must not reject his evidence, but admit it
 together with the other proofs.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There are many who are not sufficiently careful and circumspect, and
 consider that the depositions of such quarrelsome women should be altogether
 rejected, saying that no faith can be placed in them, since they are nearly
 always actuated by motives of hatred. Such men are ignorant of the subtlety
 and precautions of magistrates, and speak and judge like men who are
 colour-blind. But these precautions are dealt with in Questions XI and XII.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question VIII</h2>
<h3>Which Follows from the Preceding Question, Whether the Witch is to be Imprisoned, and of the Method of Taking her. This is the Third Action of the Judge</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is asked whether, after she has denied the accusation, the witch ought
 to be kept in custody in prison, when the three aforesaid conditions, namely,
 her reputation, the evidence of the fact, and the depositions of witnesses,
 are in agreement; or whether she should be dismissed with the security of
 sureties, so that she may again be called and questioned. As to this question
 there are three opinions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First, it is the opinion of some that she should be sent to prison, and that
 by no means ought she to be dismissed under bond; and they hold this opinion
 on the strength of the reasoning brought forward in the preceding question,
 namely, that she is to be considered as manifestly guilty when all those
 three considerations are in agreement.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Others, again, think that before she is imprisoned she may be dismissed with
 the safeguard of sureties; so that if she makes her escape, she can then be
 considered as convicted. But after she has been imprisoned because of her
 negative answers, she is not to be released under any safeguard or condition
 of bail, that is, when those three considerations noted above are in
 agreement; because in that case she could not subsequently be sentenced and
 punished by death; and this, they say, is the general custom.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third opinion is that no definite rule can be given, but that it must
 be left to the Judge to act in accordance with the gravity of the matter as
 shown by the testimony of the witnesses, the reputation of the accused, and
 the evidence as to the fact, and the extent to which these three agree with
 each other; and that he should follow the custom of the country. And they
 who hold this opinion conclude by saying that if reputable and responsible
 sureties are not to be procured, and the accused is suspected of contemplating
 flight, she should then be cast into prison. And this third opinion seems to
 be the most reasonable, as long as the correct procedure if observed; and
 this consists in three things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First, that her house should be searched
 as thoroughly as possible, in all holes and corners and chests, top and
 bottom; and if she is a noted witch, then without doubt, unless she has
 previously hidden them, there will be found various instruments of
 witchcraft, as we have shown above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, if she has a maid-servant or companions, that she or they should
 be shut up by themselves; for though they are not accused, yet it is
 presumed that none of the accused's secrets are hidden from them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, in taking her, if she be taken in her own house, let her not be
 given time to go into her room; for they are wont to secure in this way, and
 bring away with them, some object or power of witchcraft which procures them
 the faculty of keeping silent under examination.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This gives rise to the question whether the method employed by some to
 capture a witch is lawful, namely, that she should be lifted from the ground
 by the officers, and carried out in a basket or on a plank of wood so that
 she cannot again touch the ground. This can be answered by the opinion of
 the Canonists and of certain Theologians, that this is lawful in three
 respects. First, because, as is shown in the introductory question of this
 Third Part, it is clear from the opinion of many authorities, and especially
 of such Doctors as no one would dare to dispute, as Duns Scotus, Henry of
 Segusio and Godfrey of Fontaines, that it is lawful to oppose vanity with
 vanity. Also we know from experience and the confessions of witches that
 when they are taken in this manner they more often lose the power of keeping
 silence under examination: indeed many who have been about to be burned have
 asked that they might be allowed at least to touch the ground with one foot;
 and when this has been asked why they made such a request, they have
 answered that if they had touched the ground they would have liberated
 themselves, striking many other people dead with lightning.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second reason is this. It was manifestly shown in the Second Part of
 this work that a witch loses all her power when she falls into the hands of
 public justice, that is, with regard to the past; but with regard to the
 future, unless she receives from the devil fresh powers of keeping silent,
 she will confess all her crimes. Therefore let us say with
 S. Paul: Whatsoever we do in word or deed,
 let all be done in the name of the Lord JESUS Christ. And if the witch be
 innocent, this form of capture will not harm her.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, according to the Doctors it is lawful to counteract witchcraft by
 vain means; for they all agree as to this, though they are at variance over
 the question as to when those vain means may also be unlawful. Therefore
 when Henry of Segusio says that it is lawful to oppose vanity with vanity,
 this is explained as meaning that he speaks of vain means, not of unlawful
 means. All the more, then, is it lawful to obstruct witchcraft; and it is
 this obstruction which is referred to here, and not any unlawful practice.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let the Judge note also that there are two sorts of imprisonment; one being
 a punishment inflicted upon criminals, but the other only a matter of
 custody in the house of detention. And these two sorts are noted in the
 chapter <i>multorum querela;</i> therefore she ought at least to be placed
 in custody. But if it is only a slight matter of which she is accused, and
 she is not of bad reputation, and there is no evidence of her work upon
 children or animals, then she may be sent back to her house. But because
 she has certainly associated with witches and knows their secrets, she must
 give sureties; and if she cannot do so, she must be bound by oaths and
 penalties not to go out of her house unless she is summoned. But her
 servants and domestics, of whom we spoke above, must be kept in custody,
 yet not punished.

<h2>Question IX</h2>
<h3>What is to be done after the Arrest, and whether the Names of the Witnesses should be made Known to the Accused. This is the Fourth Action</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THERE are two matters to be attended to after the arrest, but it is left
 to the Judge which shall be taken first; namely, the question of allowing
 the accused to be defended, and whether she should be examined in the
 place of torture, though not necessarily in order that she should be
 tortured. The first is only allowed when a direct request is made; the
 second only when her servants and companions, if she has any, have first
 been examined in the house.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But let us proceed in the order as above. If the accused says that she is
 innocent and falsely accused, and that she wishes to see and hear her
 accusers, then it is a sign that she is asking to defend herself. But it
 is an open question whether the Judge is bound to make the deponents
 known to her and bring them to confront her face to face. For here let
 the Judge take note that he is not bound either to publish the names of
 the deponents or to bring them before the accused, unless they themselves
 should freely and willingly offer to come before the accused and lay
 their depositions in her presence And it is by reason of the danger
 incurred by the deponents that the Judge is not bound to do this. For
 although different Popes have had different opinions on this matter,
 none of them has ever said that in such a case the Judge is bound to
 make known to the accused the names of the informers or accusers (but here
 we are not dealing with the case of an accuser). On the contrary, some
 have thought that in no case ought he to do so, while others have thought
 that he should in certain circumstances.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But, finally, Bonifice VIII decreed as follows:
 If in a case of heresy it appear to the Bishop or Inquisitor that grave
 danger would be incurred by the witnesses of informers on account of the
 powers of the persons against whom they lay their depositions, should
 their names be published, he shall not publish them. But if there is no
 danger, their names shall be published just as in other cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be noted that this refers not only to a Bishop or Inquisitor,
 but to any Judge conducting a case against witches with the consent of the
 Inquisitor or Bishop; for, as was shown in the introductory Question, they
 can depute their duties to a Judge. So that any such Judge, even if he be
 secular, has the authority of the Pope, and not only of the Emperor.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also a careful Judge will take notice of the powers of the accused persons;
 for these are of three kinds, namely, the power of birth and family, the
 power of riches, and the power of malice. And the last of these is more to
 be feared than the other two, since it threatens more danger to the
 witnesses if their names are made known to the accused. The reason for this is
 that it is more dangerous to make known the names of the witnesses to an
 accused person who is poor, because such a person has many evil accomplices,
 such as outlaws and homicides, associated with him, who venture nothing but
 their own persons, which is not the case with anyone who is nobly born or
 rich, and abounding in temporal possessions. And the kind of danger which is
 to be feared is explained by Pope John XXII as the death of cutting off
 of themselves or their children or kindred, or the wasting of their
 substance, or some such matter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Further, let the Judge take notice that, as he acts in this matter with the
 authority of the Supreme Pontiff and the permission of the Ordinary, both
 he himself and all who are associated with him at the depositions, or
 afterwards at the pronouncing of the sentence, must keep the names of the
 witnesses secret, under pain of excommunication. And it is in the power of
 the Bishop thus to punish him or them if they do otherwise. Therefore he
 should very implicitly warn them not to reveal the name from the very
 beginning of the process.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore the above decrees of Pope Bonifice VIII goes on to say: And that
 the danger to those accusers and witnesses may be the more effectively
 met, and the inquiry conducted more cautiously, we permit, by the
 authority of this statute, that the Bishop or Inquisitors (or, as we have
 said, the Judge) shall forbid all those who are concerned in the inquiry
 to reveal without their permission any secrets which they have learned from
 the Bishop or Inquisitors, under pain of excommunication, which they may
 incur by violating such secrets.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is further to be noted that just as it is a punishable offence to
 publish the names of witnesses indiscreetly, so also it is to conceal them
 without good reason from, for instance, such people as have a right to know
 them, such as the lawyers and assessors whose opinion is to be sought in
 proceeding to the sentence; in the same way the names must not be concealed
 when it is possible to publish them without risk of any danger to the
 witnesses. On this subject the above decree speaks as follows, towards the
 end: We command that in all cases the Bishop or Inquisitors shall take
 especial care not to suppress the names of the witnesses as if there were
 danger to them when there is perfect security, not conversely to decide to
 publish them when there is some danger threatened, the decision in this
 matter resting with their own conscience and discretion. And it has been
 written in comment on these words: Whoever you are who are a Judge in such
 a case, mark those words well, for they do not refer to a slight risk but
 to a grave danger; therefore do not deprive a prisoner of his legal rights
 without very good cause, for this cannot but be an offence to Almighty God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The reader must note that all the process which we have already described,
 and all that we have yet to describe, up to the methods of passing sentence
 (except the death sentence), which it is in the province of the
 ecclesiastical Judge to conduct, can also, with the consent of the Diocesans,
 be conducted by a secular Judge. Therefore the reader need find no difficulty
 in the fact that the above Decree speaks of an ecclesiastical and not a
 secular Judge; for the latter can take his method of inflicting the death
 sentence from that of the Ordinary in passing sentence of penance.

<h2>Question X</h2>
<h3>What Kind of Defence may be Allowed, and of the Appointment of an Advocate. This is the Fifth Action</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 IF, therefore, the accused asked to be defended, how can this be admitted when the names of the
 witnesses are kept altogether secret? It is to be said that three considerations are to be
 observed in admitting any defence. First, that an Advocate shall be allotted to the accused.
 Second, that the names of the witnesses shall not be made known to the Advocate, even under an
 oath of secrecy, but that he shall be informed of everything contained in the depositions. Third,
 the accused shall as far as possible be given the benefit of every doubt, provided that this
 involves no scandal to the faith nor is in any way detrimental to justice, as will be shown. And
 in like manner the prisoner’s procurator shall have full access to the whole process, only the
 names of the witnesses and deponents being suppressed; and the Advocate can act also in the name
 of procurator.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; As to the first of these points: it should be noted that an Advocate
 is not to be appointed at the desire of the accused, as if he may choose which Advocate he will have; but the Judge must take great care to appoint neither a litigious nor an evil-minded man, nor yet one who is easily bribed (as many are), but rather an honourable man to whom no sort of suspicion attaches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; And the Judge ought to note four points, and if the Advocate be found to conform to them, he shall be allowed to plead, but not otherwise. For first of all the Advocate must examine the nature of the case, and then if he finds it a just one he may undertake it, but if he finds it unjust he must refuse it; and he must be very careful not to undertake an unjust or desperate case. But if he has unwittingly accepted the brief, together with a fee, from someone who wishes to do him an injury, but discovers during the process that the case is hopeless, then he must signify to his client (that is, the accused) that he abandons the case, and must return the fee which he has received. This is the opinion of Godfrey of Fontaines, which is wholly in conformity with the Canon <i>de jud. i, rem non novam</i>. But Henry of Segusio holds an opposite view concerning the return of the fee in a case in which the Advocate has worked very hard. Consequently if an Advocate has wittingly undertaken to defend a prisoner whom he knows to be guilty, he shall be liable for the costs and expenses (<i>de admin. tut. i, non tamen est ignotum</i>).<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; The second point to be observed is that in his pleading he should conduct himself properly in three respects. First, his behaviour must be modest and free from prolixity or pretentious oratory. Secondly, he must abide by the truth, not bringing forward any fallacious arguments or reasoning, or calling false witnesses, or introducing legal quirks and quibbles if he be a skilled lawyer, or bringing counter-accusations; especially in cases of this sort, which must be conducted as simply and summarily as possible. Thirdly, his fee must be regulated by the usual practice of the district.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; But to return to our point; the Judge must make the above conditions clear to the Advocate, and finally admonish him not to incur the charge of defending heresy, which would make him liable to excommunication.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; And it is not a valid argument for him to say to the Judge that he is not defending the error, but the person. For he must not by any means so conduct his defence as to prevent the case from being conducted in a plain and summary manner, and he would be doing so if he introduced any complications or appeals into it; all which things are disallowed together. For it is granted that he does not defend the error; for in that case he would be more damnably guilty than the witches themselves, and rather a heresiarch than a heretical wizard. Nevertheless, if he unduly defends a person already suspect of heresy, he makes himself as it were a patron of that heresy,  and lays himself under not only a light but a strong suspicion, in accordance with the manner of his defence; and ought publicly to abjure that heresy before the Bishop.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; We have put this matter at some length, and it is not to be neglected by the Judge, because much danger may arise from an improper conducting of the defence by an Advocate or Procurator. Therefore, when there is any objection to the Advocate, the Judge must dispense with him and proceed in accordance with the facts and the proofs. But when the Advocate for the accused is not open to any objection, but is a zealous man and lover of justice, then the Judge may reveal to him the names of the witnesses, under an oath of secrecy.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question XI</h2>
<h3>What Course the Advocate should Adopt when the Names of the Witnesses are not Revealed to him. Ths Sixth Action</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 BUT it may be asked: What, then, should the Advocate acting a Procurator for the accused do, when the names of the witnesses are withheld from both himself and his client, although the accused earnestly desires that they should be made known? We answer that he should obtain information from the Judge on every point of the accusation, which must be given to him at his request, only the names of the witnesses being suppressed; and with this information he should approach the accused and, if the matter involves a very grave charge, exhort him to exercise all the patience which he can.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if the accused again and again insists that she should know the names of the witnesses against her, he can answer her as follows: You can guess from the charges which are made against you who are the witnesses. For the child or beast of so and so has been bewitched; or to such a woman or man, because they refused to lend you something for which you asked, you said, "You shall know that it would have been better to have agreed to my request," and they bear witness that in consequence of your words the person was suddenly taken ill; and facts are stronger evidence than words. And you know that you have a bad reputation, and have for a long time been suspected of casting spells upon and injuring many men. And talking in this manner, he may finally induce her to enter a plea that they had borne witness against her from motives of hatred; or to say, "I confess that I did say so, but not with any intent to do harm."<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore the Advocate must first lay before the Judge and his assessors this plea of personal enmity, and the Judge must inquire into it. And if it should be found to be a case of mortal enmity, as that there has been some attempted or accomplished murder committed by the husbands or kindred of the parties, or that someone of one party has been charged with a crime by someone of the other party, so that he fell into the hands of public justice, or that serious wounds have resulted from quarrels and brawls between them; then the upright and careful Judge will consult with his assessors whether the accused of the deponent was the aggravating party. For if, for example, the husband or friends of the accused have unjustly oppressed the friends of the deponent, then if there is no evidence of the fact that children or animals or men have been bewitched, and if there are no other witnesses, and the accused is not even commonly suspected of witchcraft, in that case it is presumed that the depositions were laid against her from motives of vengeance, and she is to be discharged as innocent and freely dismissed, after having been duly cautioned against seeking to avenge herself, in the manner which is usually used by Judges.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The following case may be put. Katharina’s child, or she herself, is bewitched, or she has suffered much loss of her cattle; and she suspects the accused because her husband or brothers had previously brought on an unjust accusation against her own husband or brother. Here the cause of enmity is twofold on the part of the deponent, having its root both in her own bewitchment and in the unjust accusation brought against her husband or brother. Then ought her deposition to be rejected or not? From one point of view it seems that it should, because she is actuated by enmity; from another point of view it should not, because there is the evidence of the fact in her bewitchment.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We answer that if in this case there are no other deponents, and the accused is not even under common suspicion, then her depositions cannot be allowed, but must be rejected; but if the accused is rendered suspect, and if the disease is not due to natural causes but to witchcraft (and we shall show later how this can be distinguished), she is to be subjected to a canonical purgation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 If it be asked further whether the other deponents must bear witness to the evidence of the fact as experienced by themselves or others, or only to the public reputation of the accused; we answer that, if they give evidence of the fact, so much the better. But if they only give evidence as to her general character, and the matter stands so, then, although the Judge must reject that deponent on the grounds of personal enmity, yet he shall take the evidence of the fact, and of her bad reputation given by the other witnesses, as proof that the accused must be strongly suspect, and on these grounds he can sentence her to a threefold punishment: namely, to a canonical purgation because of her reputation; or to an abjuration, because of the suspicion under which she rests, and there are various forms of abjuration for various degrees of suspicion, as will be shown in the fourth method of passing sentence; or, because of the evidence of the fact, and if she confesses her crime and is penitent, she shall not be handed over to the secular branch for capital punishment, but be sentenced by the ecclesiastical Judge to imprisonment for life. But notwithstanding the fact that she has been sentenced to imprisonment for life by the ecclesiastical Judge, the secular Judge can, on account of the temporal injuries which she has committed, deliver her to be burned. But all these matters will be made clear later when we deal with the sixth method of passing sentence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To sum up: Let the Judge first take care not to lend too easy belief to the Advocate when he pleads mortal enmity on behalf of the accused; for in these cases it is very seldom that anyone bears witness without enmity, because witches are always hated by everybody. Secondly, let him take note that there are four ways by which a witch can be convicted, namely, by witnesses, by direct evidence of the fact, and by her own confession. And if she is detained on account of a general report, she can be convicted by the evidence of witnesses; if on account of definite suspicion, the direct or indirect evidence of the facts can convict her, and by reason of these the suspicion may be judged to be either light or strong or grave. All this is when she does not confess; but when she does, the case can proceeds as has been said.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, let the Judge make use of all the foregoing circumstances to meet the plea of the Advocate, whether the accused is charged only by reason of a general report, or whether there are also certain evidences to support the charge by which she incurs slight or strong suspicion; and then he will be able to answer the Advocate’s allegation of personal enmity, which is the first line of defence which he may assume.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But when the Advocate assumes the second line of defence, admitting that the accused has used such words against the deponent as, "You shall soon know what is going to happen to you," or "You will wish soon enough that you had lent or sold me what I asked for," or some such words; and submits that, although the deponent afterwards experienced some injury either to this person or his property, yet it does not follow from this that the accused was the cause of it as a witch, for illnesses may be due to various different causes. Also he submits that it is a common habit of women to quarrel together with such words, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The Judge ought to answer such allegations in the following manner. If the illness is due to natural causes, then the excuse is good. But the evidence indicates the contrary; for it cannot be cured by any natural remedy; or in the opinion of the physicians the illness is due to witchcraft, or is what is in common speech called a Night-scathe. Again, perhaps other enchantresses are of the opinion that it is due to witchcraft. Or because it came suddenly, without any previous sickening, whereas natural diseases generally develop gradually. Or perhaps because the plaintiff had found certain instruments of witchcraft under his bed or in his clothes or elsewhere, and when these were removed he was suddenly restored to health, as often happens, as we showed in the Second Part of this work where we treated of remedies. And by some such answer as this the Judge can easily meet this allegation, and show that the illness was due rather to witchcraft than to any natural causes, and that the accused must be suspected of causing such witchcraft, by reason of her threatening words. In the same way, if someone said, "I wish your barn would be burned down," and this should afterwards happen, it would engender a grave suspicion that the person who had used that threat had caused the barn to be set on fire, even if another person, and not he himself, had actually set light to it.<br/>

<h2>Question XII</h2>
<h3>Of the Same Matter, Declaring more Particularly how the Question of Personal Enmity is to be Investigated. The Seventh Action</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 TAKE notice that only mortal enemies are debarred from giving evidence, as was shown in the
 Fifth Question. But the Judge may consider that to come to a decision about such enmity by the
 means we have just explained is rather dubious and unsatisfactory; and the accused or her
 Procurator may not be willing to accept a decision arrived at on such grounds as to whether
 the enmity is mortal or not. Therefore the Judge must use other means to decide concerning the
 alleged enmity, so that he may not punish the innocent, but exact full justice from the guilty.
 And though these means may savour of cunning and even guile, yet the Judge may employ them for
 the good of the faith and the State; for even S. Paul says: But being crafty, I caught you by
 guile. And these means are especially to be employed in the case of a prisoner who has not been
 publically defamed, and is not suspected because of the evidence of any fact; and the Judge may
 also employ them against prisoners who have alleged enmity on the part of the deponents, and
 wish to know all the names of the witnesses.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The first method is this. The accused or her Advocate is given a copy of the process with the
 names of the deponents or informers, but not in the order in which they deposed; but in such a
 way that the name of the witness who comes first in the copy is sixth or seventh in the schedule,
 and he who comes second is last or last but one. In this way the accused will be deceived as to
 which witness deposed this or that. And then she will either say that they are all her enemies,
 or not; and if she says that they all are, she will be more easily detected in a lie when the
 cause of the enmity is investigated by the Judge; and if she names only certain ones, still the
 cause of the enmity will be more easily investigated.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second method is similar, when the Advocate is given a copy of the process, and separately a
 list of the names of the deponents; but there are added other matters perpetrated elsewhere by
 witches, but not set down in writing by the witnesses or deponents. And so the accused will not
 be able to say definitely that this one or that one is her mortal enemy, because she does not
 know what they have deposed against her.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third method was touched upon in the Fifth Question above. For when the accused is
 questioned at the end of her second examination, and before she has demanded to be defended or
 an Advocate has been allotted to her, let her be asked whether she thinks that she has any
 mortal enemies who, setting aside all fear of God, would falsely accuse her of the crime of
 heresy and witchcraft. And then perhaps without thinking, and not having seen the depositions of
 the witnesses, she will answer that she does not think that she has any such enemies. Or if she
 says, “I think I have,” and names any of the witnesses who have laid information,
 and the reason for that enmity is known, then the Judge will be able to investigate it with
 more certainty afterwards, when the accused has been given separate copies of the process and of
 the names of the witnesses, in the manner we have explained.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The fourth method is this. At the end of her second examination and confession (as we showed in
 the Sixth Question), before she is granted any means of defence, let her be questioned as to the
 witnesses who have laid the more serious charges against her, in this manner. “Do you know
 So-and-so?• naming one of the witnesses; and then she will answer either Yes or No. If she
 says No, she will not be able, after she has been given means of defence and an Advocate, to
 plead that he is a mortal enemy, since she has said on oath that she does not know him. But if
 she says Yes, let her be asked whether she knows or has heard that he or she has acted in any
 way contrary to the Christian faith in the manner of a witch. Then if she says Yes, for he did
 such and such a thing; let her be asked whether he is her friend or enemy; and she will
 immediately answer that he is her friend, because of the testimony of such is not of very great
 account; and consequently she will not be able afterwards to plead an oath through her Advocate
 that he is her enemy, for she has already said that he is her friend. But if she answers that
 she knows nothing about him, let her again be asked whether he is her friend or enemy, and she
 will at once answer that he is her friend; for it would be futile to allege enmity on the part
 of someone of whom she knows nothing. Therefore she says, “I am his friend, but if I knew
 anything about him I would not fail to reveal it.” Therefore she will not be able
 afterwards to plead that her is her enemy. Or perhaps she will from the very beginning allege
 reasons for mortal enmity, and in that case some credence must be placed in the plea of the
 Advocate.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A fifth method is to give the Advocate or the accused a copy of the process, with the names of
 the informers suppressed. And then the accused will guess, and very often rightly, who has
 deposed such and such against her. And then if she says, “So-and-so is my mortal enemy,
 and I am willing to prove it by witnesses,” then the Judge must consider whether the
 person named is the same person named in the schedule, and since she has said that she is
 willing to prove it by witnesses, he will examine those witnesses and inquire into the causes
 of the enmity, having secretly called into consultation learned and aged men of known prudence.
 And if he finds sufficient reasons for mortal enmity, he shall reject that evidence and dismiss
 the prisoner, unless there are other grave charges against her, sworn to by other witnesses.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this fifth method is commonly used; and it is found in practice that witches quickly guess
 from the copy of the process who has laid information against them. And because in such cases
 mortal enmity is rarely found unless it arises from the wicked deeds of the witch, therefore
 the Judge can easily come to a decision by the above means. Also it is to be noted that often
 the informers desire to confront the witch personally, and to charge her to her face with the
 bewitchment which has befallen them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is still one more method whereunto the Judge may finally have recourse, when perhaps the
 other methods, and especially the first four, seem to some to savour too much of cunning and
 deceit. Accordingly, to satisfy and content the scrupulous, and that no fault may be found with
 the Judge, let him take care, after he has found by the above methods that there is no mortal
 enmity between the accused and the deponent, but wishes to remove all grounds for complaint
 by settling the question finally in consultation with his other assessors, to act as follows.
 Let him give to the accused or her Advocate a copy of the process, with the names of the
 deponents or informers suppressed. And since her defence is that she has mortal enemies, and
 perhaps she has alleged various reasons for the enmity, whether or not the facts are in
 agreement with her statements, let the Judge call into consultation learned men of every faculty
 (if such can be had), or at least some honest and reputable persons (for this is the purport of
 that statute we have so often quoted); and let him cause the whole process to be read through
 to them from end to end by the Notary or scribe, and let the names of the witnesses be made
 known to them, but under an oath of secrecy; and he shall first inquire whether or not they are
 willing to be bound by such an oath, for if not the names must by no means be declared to
 them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Then let him tell how he has inquired in such and such a manner into the alleged enmity, and has
 not been able to find any testimony of fact. But he shall add that, if they please, one of two
 courses shall be pursued. Either they shall decide then and there in consultation whether the
 evidence of any of the witnesses shall be rejected on the grounds of mortal personal enmity; or
 let them choose three or four or five persons who have most knowledge in that town or village of
 any friendship or enmity between the accused and the informer, who are not present at the
 consultation, and let them be informed of the names only of the accused and the witness, but not
 of the information which has been deposed, and let the whole question be left to their
 judgement. If they follow the former of these courses, they cannot very well reject any witness,
 since the Judge has already used his own methods of investigation; but by the second course
 he protects himself perfectly, and clears himself of all ugly suspicions. And he ought to observe
 this last method when the accused has been taken in a foreign town or country. These methods
 will suffice for examining the question of personal enmity.

<h2>Question XIII</h2>
<h3>Of the Points to be Observed by the Judge before the Formal Examination in the Place of Detention and Torture. This is the Eighth Action</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE next action of the Judge is quite clear. For common justice demands that a witch should not be condemned to death unless she is convicted by her own confession. But here we are considering the case of one who is judged to be taken in manifest heresy for one of the other two reasons set down in the First Question, namely, direct or indirect evidence of the fact, or the legitimate production of witnesses; and in this case she is to be exposed to questions and torture to extort a confession of her crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And to make the matter clear we will quote a case which occurred at Spires and came to the knowledge of many. A certain honest man was bargaining with a woman, and would not come to terms with her about the price of some article; so she angrily called after him, "You will soon wish you had agreed." For witches generally use this manner of speaking, or something like it, when they wish to bewitch a person by looking at him. Then he, not unreasonably being angry with her, looked over his shoulder to see with what intention she had uttered those words; and behold! he was suddenly bewitched so that his mouth was stretched sideways as far as his ears in a horrible deformity, and he could not draw it back, but remained so deformed for a long time.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We put this case that this was submitted to the Judge as direct evidence of the fact; and it is asked whether the woman is to be considered as manifestly taken in the heresy of witchcraft. This should be answered from the words of S. Bernard which we have quoted above. For there are three ways in which a person may be judged to be so taken, and they not so closely conjoined as though it were necessary for all three to agree in one conclusion, but each one by itself, namely, the evidence of the fact, or the legitimate production of witnesses, or her own confession, is sufficient to prove a witch to be manifestly taken in that heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But indirect evidence of the fact is different from direct evidence; yet thought it is not so conclusive, it is still taken from the words and deeds of witches, as was shown in the Seventh Question, and it is judged from witchcraft which is not so immediate in its effect, but follows after some lapse of time from the utterance of the threatening words. Wherefore may we conclude that this is the case with such witches who have been accused and have not made good their defence (or have failed to defend themselves because this privilege was not granted them; and it was not granted because they did not ask for it). But what we are to consider now is what action the Judge should take, and how he should proceed to question the accused with a view to extorting the truth from her so that sentence of death may finally be passed upon her.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And here, because of the great trouble caused by the stubborn silence of witches, there are several points which the Judge must notice, and these are dealt with under their several heads.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the first is that he must not be too quick to subject a witch to examination, but must pay attention to certain signs which will follow. And he must not be too quick for this reason: unless God, through a holy Angel, compels the devil to withhold his help from the witch, she will be so insensible to the pains of torture that she will sooner be torn limb from limb than confess any of the truth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the torture is not to be neglected for this reason, for they are not all equally endowed with this power, and also the devil sometimes of his own will permits them to confess their crimes without being compelled by a holy Angel. And for the understanding of this the reader is referred to that which is written in the Second Part of this work concerning the homage which they offer to the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For there are some who obtain from the devil a respite of six or eight or ten years before they have to offer him their homage, that is, devote themselves to him body and soul; whereas others, when they first profess their abjuration of the faith, at the same time offer their homage. And the reason why the devil allows that stipulated interval of time is that, during that time, he may find out whether the witch has denied the faith with her lips only but not in her heart, and would therefore offer him her homage in the same way.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the devil cannot know the inner thoughts of the heart except conjecturally from outward indications, as we showed in the First Part of this work where we dealt with the question whether devils can turn the minds of men to hatred or love. And many have been found who, driven by some necessity or poverty, have been induced by other witches, in the hope of ultimate forgiveness in confession, to become either total or partial apostates from the faith. And it is such whom the devil deserts without any compulsion by a holy Angel; and therefore they readily confess their crimes, whereas others, who have from their hearts bound themselves to the devil, are protected by his power and preserve a stubborn silence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And this provides a clear answer to the question how it comes about that some witches readily confess, and others will by no means do so. For in the case of the former, when the devil is not compelled by God, he still deserts them of his own will, in order that by temporal unhappiness and a horrible death he may lead to despair those over whose hearts he could never obtain the mastery. For it is evident from their sacramental confessions that they have never voluntarily obeyed the devil, but have been compelled by him to work witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And some also are distinguished by the fact that, after they have admitted their crimes, they try to commit suicide by strangling or hanging themselves. And they are induced to do this by the Enemy, lest they should obtain pardon from God through sacramental confession. This chiefly happens in the case of those who have not been willing agents of the devil; although it may also happen in the case of willing agents, after they have confessed their crimes: but then it is because the devil has been compelled to desert the witch.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In conclusion we may say that it is as difficult, or more difficult, to compel a witch to tell the truth as it is to exorcise a person possessed of the devil. Therefore the Judge ought not to be too willing or ready to proceed to such examination, unless, as has been said, the death penalty is involved. And in this case he must exercise great care, as we shall show; and first we shall speak of the method of sentencing a witch to such torture.<br/>

<h2>Question XIV</h2>
<h3>Of the Method of Sentencing the Accused to be Questioned: and How she must be Questioned on the First Day; and Whether she may be Promised her Life. The Ninth Action</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 SECONDLY, the Judge must take care to frame his sentence in the following
 manner.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, the Judge and assessors, having attended to and considered the details of
 the process enacted by us against you N. of such a place in such a Diocese,
 and having diligently examined the whole matter, find that your are equivocal
 in your admissions; as for example, when you say that you used such threats
 with no intention of doing an injury, but nevertheless there are various
 proofs which are sufficient warrant for exposing you to the question and
 torture. Wherefore, that the truth may be known from your own mouth, and that
 henceforth you may not offend the ears of the Judges, we declare, judge and
 sentence that on this present day at such an hour you be placed under the
 question and torture. This sentence was given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Alternatively, as has been said, the Judge may not be willing to deliver the
 accused up to be questioned, but may punish her with imprisonment with the
 following object in view. Let him summon her friends and put it to the that
 she may escape the death penalty, although she will be punished in another
 way, if she confesses the truth, and urge them to try to persuade her to do
 so. For very often meditation, and the misery of imprisonment, and the
 repeated advice of honest men, dispose the accused to discover the truth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we have found that witches have been so strengthened by this sort of
 advice that, as a sign of their rebellion, they have spat on the ground as if
 it were in the devil's face, saying, “Depart, cursed devil; I shall do
 what is just” and afterwards they have confessed their crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if, after keeping the accused in a state of suspense, and continually
 postponing the day of examination, and frequently using verbal persuasions,
 the Judge should truly believe that the accused is denying the truth, let them
 question her lightly without shedding blood; knowing that such questioning is
 fallacious and often, as has been said, ineffective.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it should be begun in this way. While the officers are preparing for the
 questioning, let the accused be stripped; or if she is a woman, let her first
 be led to the penal cells and there stripped by honest women of good
 reputation. And the reason for this is that they should search for any
 instrument of witchcraft sewn into her clothes; for they often make such
 instruments, at the instruction of devils, out of the limbs of unbaptized
 children, the purpose being that those children should be deprived of the
 beatific vision. And when such instruments have been disposed of, the Judge
 shall use his own persuasions and those of other honest men zealous for the
 faith to induce her to confess the truth voluntarily; and if she will not, let
 him order the officers to bind her with cords, and apply her to some engine of
 torture; and then let them obey at once but not joyfully, rather appearing to
 be disturbed by their duty. Then let her be released again at someone's
 earnest request, and taken on one side, and let her again be persuaded; and in
 persuading her, let her be told that she can escape the death penalty.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is asked whether, in the case of a prisoner legally convicted by her
 general bad reputation, by witnesses, and by the evidence of the fact, so that
 the only thing lacking is a confession of the crime from her own mouth, the
 Judge can lawfully promise her her life, whereas if she were to confess the
 crime she would suffer the extreme penalty.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We answer that different people have various opinions on this question. For
 some hold that if the accused is of a notoriously bad reputation, and gravely
 suspected on unequivocal evidence of the crime; and if she is herself a great
 source of danger, as being the mistress of other witches, then she may be
 promised her life on the following conditions; that she be sentenced to
 imprisonment for life on bread and water, provided that she supply evidence
 which will lead to the conviction of other witches. And she is not to be told,
 when she is promised her life, that she is to be imprisoned in this way; but
 should be led to suppose that some other penance, such as exile, will be
 imposed on her as punishment. And without doubt notorious witches, especially
 such as use witches' medicines and cure the bewitched by superstitious means,
 should be kept in this way, both that they may help the bewitched, and that
 they may betray other witches. But such a betrayal by them must not be
 considered of itself sufficient ground for a conviction, since the devil is a
 liar, unless it is also substantiated by the evidence of the fact, and by
 witnesses.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Others think that, after she has been consigned to prison in this way, the
 promise to spare her life should be kept for a time, but that after a certain
 period she should be burned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A third opinion is that the Judge may safely promise the accused her life, but
 in such a way that he should afterwards disclaim the duty of passing sentence
 on her, deputing another Judge in his place.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There seems to be some advantage in pursuing the first of these courses on
 account of the benefit which may accrue from it to those who are bewitched;
 yet it is not lawful to use witchcraft to cure witchcraft, although (as was
 shown in the First and Introductory Question to this Third Part) the general
 opinion is that it is lawful to use vain and superstitious means to remove a
 spell. But use and experience and the variety of such cases will be of more
 value to Judges than any art or text-book; therefore this is a matter which
 should be left to the Judges. But it has certainly been very often found by
 experience that many would confess the truth if they were not held back by the
 fear of death.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if neither threats nor such promises will induce her to confess the truth,
 then the officers must proceed with the sentence, and she must by examined,
 not in any new or exquisite manner, but in the usual way, lightly or heavily
 according as the nature of her crimes demands. And while she is being
 questioned about each several point, let her be often and frequently exposed
 to torture, beginning with the more gentle of them; for the Judge should not
 be too hasty to proceed to the graver kind. And while this is being done, let
 the Notary write all down, how she is tortured and what questions are asked
 and how she answers.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And note that, if she confesses under torture, she should then be taken to
 another place and questioned anew, so that she does not confess only under the
 stress of torture.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The next step of the Judge should be that, if after being fittingly tortured
 she refuses to confess the truth, he should have other engines of torture
 brought before her, and tell her that she will have to endure these if she
 does not confess. If then she is not induced by terror to confess, the torture
 must be continued on the second or third day, but not repeated at that present
 time unless there should be some fresh indication of its probable success.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let the sentence be pronounced in her presence in the following manner: We the
 aforesaid Judge, as above, assign to you N. such a day for the continuation of
 your questioning, that the truth may be heard from your own mouth. And the
 Notary shall write all down in the process.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And during the interval before that assigned time the Judge himself or other
 honest men shall do all in their power to persuade her to confess the truth in
 the manner we have said, giving her, if it seems expedient to them, a promise
 that her life will be spared.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The Judge should also take care that during that interval there should always
 be guards with her, so that she is never left alone, for fear lest the devil
 will cause her to kill herself. But the devil himself knows better than anyone
 can set down in writing whether he will desert her of his own will, or be
 compelled to do so by God.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question XV</h2>
<h3>Of the Continuing of the Torture, and of the Devices and Signs by which the Judge can Recognize a Witch; and how he ought to Protect himself from their Spells. Also how they are to be Shaved in Parts where they use to Conceal the Devil's Masks and Tokens; together with the due Setting Forth of Various Means of Overcoming the Obstinacy in Keeping Silence and Refusal to Confess. And it is the Tenth Action</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE Judge should act as follows in the continuation of the torture. First he
 should bear in mind that, just as the same medicine is not applicable to all
 the members, but there are various and distinct salves for each several
 member, so not all heretics or those accused of heresy are to be subjected to
 the same method of questioning, examination and torture as to the charges laid
 against them; but various and different means are to be employed according to
 their various natures and persons. Now a surgeon cuts off rotten limbs; and
 mangy sheep are isolated from the healthy; but a prudent Judge will not
 consider it safe to bind himself down to one invariable rule in his method of
 dealing with a prisoner who is endowed with a witch's power of taciturnity,
 and whose silence he is unable to overcome. For if the sons of darkness were
 to become accustomed to one general rule they would provide means of evading
 it as a well-known snare set for their destruction.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore a prudent and zealous Judge should seize his opportunity and choose
 his method of conducting his examination according to the answers or
 depositions of the witnesses, or as his own previous experience or native wit
 indicates to him, using the following precautions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 If he wishes to find out whether she is endowed with a witch's power of
 preserving silence, let him take note whether she is able to shed tears when
 standing in his presence, or when being tortured. For we are taught both by
 the words of worthy men of old and by our own experience that this is a most
 certain sign, and it has been found that even if she be urged and exhorted by
 solemn conjurations to shed tears, if she be a witch she will not be able to
 weep: although she will assume a tearful aspect and smear her cheeks and eyes
 with spittle to make it appear that she is weeping; wherefore she must be
 closely watched by the attendants.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In passing sentence the Judge or priest may use some such method as the
 following in conjuring her to true tears if she be innocent, or in restraining
 false tears. Let him place his hand on the head of the accused and say: I
 conjure you by the bitter tears shed on the Cross by our Saviour the Lord
 JESUS Christ for the salvation of the world, and by the burning tears poured
 in the evening hour over His wounds by the most glorious Virgin MARY, His
 Mother, and by all the tears which have been
 shed here in this world by the Saints and Elect of God, from whose eyes He has
 now wiped away all tears, that if you be innocent you do now shed tears, but
 if you be guilty that you shall by no means do so. In the name of the Father,
 and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is found by experience that the more they are conjured the less are
 they able to weep, however hard they may try to do so, or smear their cheeks
 with spittle. Nevertheless it is possible that afterwards, in the absence of
 the Judge and not at the time or in the place of torture, they may be able to
 weep in the presence of their gaolers.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And as for the reason for a witch's inability to weep, it can be said that the
 grace of tears is one of the chief gifts allowed to the penitent; for S.
 Bernard tells us that the tears of the humble can penetrate to heaven and
 conquer the unconquerable. Therefore there can be no doubt that they are
 displeasing to the devil, and that he uses all his endeavour to restrain them,
 to prevent a witch from finally attaining to penitence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be objected that it might suit with the devil's cunning, with God's
 permission, to allow even a witch to weep; since tearful grieving, weaving and
 deceiving are said to be proper to women. We may answer that in this case,
 since the judgements of God are a mystery, if there is no other way of
 convicting the accused, by legitimate witnesses or the evidence of the fact,
 and if she is not under a strong or grave suspicion, she is to be discharged;
 but because she rests under a slight suspicion by reason of her reputation to
 which the witnesses have testified, she must be required to abjure the heresy
 of witchcraft, as we shall show when we deal with the second method of
 pronouncing sentence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A second precaution is to be observed, not only at this point but during the
 whole process, by the Judge and all his assessors; namely, that they must not
 allow themselves to be touched physically by the witch, especially in any
 contract of their bare arms or hands; but they must always carry about them
 some salt consecrated on Palm Sunday and some Blessed Herbs. For these can be
 enclosed together in Blessed Wax and worn round
 the neck, as we showed in the Second Part when we discussed the remedies
 against illnesses and diseases caused by witchcraft; and that these have a
 wonderful protective virtue is known not only from the testimony of witches,
 but from the use and practice of the Church, which exorcizes and blesses such
 objects for this very purpose, as is shown in the ceremony of exorcism when it
 is said, For the banishing of all the power of the devil, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But let it not be thought that physical contact of the joints or limbs is the
 only thing to be guarded against; for sometimes, with God's permission, they
 are able with the help of the devil to bewitch the Judge by the mere sound of
 the words which they utter, especially at the time when they are exposed to
 torture.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And we know from experience that some witches, when detained in prison, have
 importunately begged their gaolers to grant them this one thing, that they
 should be allowed to look at the Judge before he looks at them; and by so
 getting the first sight of the Judge they have been able so to alter the minds
 of the Judge or his assessors that they have lost all their anger against them
 and have not presumed to molest them in any way, but have allowed them to go
 free. He who knows and has experienced it gives this true testimony; and would
 that they were not able to effect such things!<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let judges not despise such precautions and protections, for by holding them
 in little account after such warning they run the risk of eternal damnation.
 For our Saviour said: If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not
 have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. Therefore let the judges protect themselves
 in the above manner, according to the provisions of the Church.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if it can conveniently be done, the witch should be led backward into the
 presence of the Judge and his assessors. And not only at the present point,
 but in all that has preceded or shall follow it, let him cross himself and
 approach her manfully, and with God's help the power of that old Serpent will
 be broken. And no one need think that it is superstitious to lead her in
 backwards; for, as we have often said, the Canonists allow even more than this
 to be done for the protections against witchcraft, and always say that it is
 lawful to oppose vanity with vanity.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third precaution to be observed in this tenth action is that the hair
 should be shaved from every part of her body. The reason for this is the same
 as that for stripping her of her clothes, which we have already mentioned; for
 in order to preserve their power of silence they are in the habit of hiding
 some superstitious object in their clothes or in their hair, or even in the
 most secret parts of the their bodies which must not be named.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be objected that the devil might, without the use of such charms,
 so harden the heart of a witch that she is unable to confess her crimes; just
 as it is often found in the case of other criminals, no matter how great the
 tortures to which they are exposed, or how much they are convicted by the
 evidence of the facts and of witnesses. We answer that it is true that the
 devil can affect such taciturnity without the use of such charms; but he
 prefers to use them for the perdition of souls and the greater offence to the
 Divine Majesty of God.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 This can be made clear from the example of a certain witch in the town of
 Hagenau, whom we have mentioned in the Second Part of this work. She used to
 obtain this gift of silence in the following
 manner: she killed a newly-born first-born male child who had not been
 baptized, and having roasted it in an oven together with other matters which
 it is not expedient to mention, ground it to powder and ashes; and if any
 witch or criminal carried about him some of this substance he would in no way
 be able to confess his crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is clear that a hundred thousand children so employed could not of
 their own virtue endow a person with such a power of keeping silence; but any
 intelligent person can understand that such means are used by the devil for
 the perdition of souls and to offend the Divine Majesty.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, it may be objected that very often criminals who are not witches
 exhibit the same power of keeping silence. In answer to this it must be said
 tat this power of taciturnity can proceed from three causes. First, from a
 natural hardness of heart; for some are soft-hearted, or even feeble-minded,
 so that at the slightest torture they admit everything, even some things which
 are not true; whereas others are so hard that however much they are tortured
 the truth is not to be had from them; and this is especially the case with
 those who have been tortured before, even if their arms are suddenly stretched
 or twisted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it may proceed from some instrument of witchcraft carried about the
 person, as has been said, either in the clothes or in the hairs of the body.
 And thirdly, even if the prisoner has no such object secreted about her
 person, they are sometimes endowed with this power by other witches, however
 far they may be removed from them. For a certain witch at Issbrug used to
 boast that, if she had no more than a thread from the garments of any
 prisoner, she could so work that however much that prisoner were tortured,
 even to death, she would be unable to confess anything. So the answer to this
 objection is clear.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But what is to be said of a case that happened in the Diocese of Ratisbon?
 Certain heretics were convicted by their own confession not only as impenitent
 but as open advocates of that perfidy; and when they were condemned to death
 it happened that they remained unharmed in the fire. At length their sentence
 was altered to death by drowning, but this was no more effective. All were
 astonished, and some even began to say that their heresy must be true; and the
 Bishop, in great anxiety for his flock, ordered a three days' fast. When this
 had been devoutly fulfilled, it came to the knowledge of someone that those
 heretics had a magic charm sewed between the skin and the flesh under one arm;
 and when this was found and removed, they were delivered to the flames and
 immediately burned. Some say that a certain necromancer learned this secret
 during a consultation with the devil, and betrayed it; but however it became
 known, it is probably that the devil, who is always scheming for the
 subversion of faith, was in some way compelled by Divine power to reveal the
 matter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From this it may be seen what a Judge ought to do when such a case happens to
 him: namely, that he should rely upon the protection of God, and by the
 prayers and fasting of devout persons drive away this sort of devil's work
 from witches, in those cases where they cannot be made to confess under
 torture even after their clothes have been changed and all their hair has been
 shaved off and abraded.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now in the parts of Germany such shaving, especially of the secret parts, is
 not generally considered delicate, and therefore we Inquisitors do not use it;
 but we cause the hair of their head to be cut off, and placing a morsel of
 Blessed Wax in a cup of Holy Water and invoking the most Holy Trinity, we give
 it them to drink three times on a fasting stomach, and by the grace of God we
 have by this means caused many to break their silence. But in other countries
 the Inquisitors order the witch to be shaved all over her body. And the
 Inquisitor of Como has informed us that last year, that is, in 1485, he
 ordered forty-one witches to be burned, after they had been shaved all over.
 And this was in the district and county of Burbia, commonly called Wormserbad,
 in the territory of the Archduke of Austria, towards Milan.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it may be asked whether, in a time of need, when all other means of
 breaking a witch's silence have failed, it would be lawful to ask the advice
 in this matter of sorceresses who are able to cure those who are bewitched. We
 answer that, whatever may have been doe in that matter at Ratisbon, it is our
 earnest admonition in the Lord that no one, no matter how great may be the
 need, should consult with sorceresses on behalf of the State; and this because
 of the great offence which is thereby caused to the Divine Majesty, when there
 are so many other means open to us which we may use either in their own proper
 form or in some equivalent form, so that the truth will be had from their own
 mouths and they can be consigned to the flames; or failing this, God will in
 the meantime provide some other death for the witch.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For there remain to us the following remedies against this power of silence.
 First, let a man do all that lies in his own power by the exercise of his
 qualities, persisting often with the methods we have already mentioned, and
 especially on certain days, as will be shown in the following Question. See
 II. <i>Corinthians</i> ix: That ye may abound in all good works.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, if this should fail, let him consult with other persons; for perhaps
 they may think of some means which has not occurred to him, since there are
 various methods of counteracting witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, if these two fail, let him have recourse to devout persons, as it is
 said in <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> xxxvii: Be continually with a godly man, whom
 thou knowest to keep the commandments of the Lord. Also let him invoke the
 Patron Saints of the country. But if all these fail, let the Judge and all the
 people at once put their trust in God with prayers and fasting, that the
 witchcraft may be removed by reason of their piety. For so Josaphat prayed in
 II. <i>Paralipomenon</i> xx: When we know no what we should do, we have this
 one refuge, that we should turn our eyes to Thee. And without doubt God will
 not fail us in our need.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To this effect also S. Augustine speaks (26, q. 7, non <i>obseruabitis</i>):
 Whosoever observes any divinations or auguries, or attends to or consents to
 such as observe them, or gives credit to such by following after their works,
 or goes into their houses, or introduces them into his own house, or asks
 questions of them, let him know that he has perverted the Christian faith and
 his baptism and is a pagan and apostate and enemy of God, unless he is
 corrected by ecclesiastical penances and is reconciled with God. Therefore let
 the Judge not fail always to use the lawful remedies, as we have said,
 together with these following final precautions.

<h2>Question XVI</h2>
<h3>Of the fit Time and of the Method of the Second Examination. And it is the Eleventh Action, concerning the Final Precautions to be Observed by the Judge</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THERE are one or two points to be noted with regard to what we have just
 written. First, that witches should be questioned on the more Holy Days and
 during the solemnization of the Mass, and that the people should be exhorted
 to pray for Divine help, not in any specific manner, but that they should
 invoke the prayers of the Saints against all the plagues of the devil.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, as we have said before, the Judge should wear round his neck
 Consecrated Salt and other matters, with the Seven Words which Christ uttered
 on the Cross written in a schedule, and all bound together. And he should, if
 he conveniently can, wear these made into the length of Christ's stature
 against his naked body, and bind other Holy things about him. For it is shown
 by experience that witches are greatly troubled by these things, and can
 hardly refrain from confessing the truth. The Relics of the Saints, too, are
 of especial virtue.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Having taken these precautions, and after giving her Holy Water to drink, let
 him again begin to question her, all the time exhorting her as before. And
 while she is raised from the ground, if she is being tortured in this way, let
 the Judge read or cause to be read to her the depositions of the witnesses
 with their names, saying: “See! You are convicted by the
 witnesses.” Also, if the witnesses are willing to confront her face to
 face, the Judge shall ask her if she will confess if the witnesses are brought
 before her. And if she consents, let the witnesses be brought in and stand
 before her, so that she may be contrained or shamed into confessing some of
 her crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Finally, if he sees that she will not admit her crimes, he shall ask her
 whether, to prove her innocence, she is ready to undergo the ordeal by red-hot
 iron. And they all desire this, knowing that the devil will prevent them from
 being hurt; therefore a true witch is exposed in this manner. The Judge shall
 ask her how she can be so rash as to run so great a risk, and all shall be
 written down; but it will be shown later that they are never to be allowed to
 undergo this ordeal by red-hot iron.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let the Judge also not that when witches are questioned on a Friday, while the
 people are gathered together at Holy Mass to await our Saviour, they very
 often confess.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But we must proceed to the extreme case, when after every expedient has been
 tried the witch still maintains silence. The Judge shall then loose her and,
 using the precautions which follow, shall take her from the place of
 punishment to another place under a strong guard; but let him take particular
 care not to release her on any sort of security; for when that is done, they
 never confess the truth, but always become worse.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But in the first place let him cause her to be well treated in the manner of
 food and drink, and meanwhile let honest persons who are under no suspicion
 enter to her and talk often with her on indifferent subjects, and finally
 advise her in confidence to confess the truth, promising that the Judge will be
 merciful to her and that they will intercede for her. And finally let the
 Judge come in and promise that he will be merciful with the mental reservation
 that he means he will be merciful to himself or the State; for whatever is
 done for the safety of the State is merciful.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he promises her her life, as we showed in Question XIV that he can do
 in three ways, let it all be written down by the Notary in what words and with
 what intention mercy was promised. And if the accused begs for mercy in this
 way, and discovers her crime, let her be promised in a vague and general way
 that she will receive even more than she has petitioned for, so that she may
 speak with the greater confidence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As a second precaution in this case, when she refuses altogether to reveal the
 truth, the Judge should, as we have said before, examine her friends and
 associates without her knowledge; and if these have deposed anything which
 might lead to her conviction, this must be diligently investigated. Also, if
 any instruments or unguents or boxes have been found in her house, they should
 be shown to her, and she should be asked for what purposes they have been
 used.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A third precaution can be taken when she still persists in her obstinancy
 after her associates have been examined and borne witness against her, and not
 for her. If she has no friends, let some other trustworthy man who is known to
 be congenial to the accused and to some extent a patron of hers, enter to the
 witch one evening and engage her in a protracted conversation. And then, if he
 is not an accomplice, let him pretend that it is too late for him to return,
 and stay in the prison with her, and continue talking during the night. And if
 he is an accomplice, let them eat and drink together, and talk to each other
 about the things they have done. And then let it be arranged that spies should
 stand outside in a convenient place, and listen to them and take note of their
 words, and if necessary let the have a scribe with them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As a fourth precaution, if she then begins to tell the truth, let the Judge on
 no account postpone hearing her confession, even in the middle of the night,
 buy proceed with it to the best of his ability. And if it is in the day-time,
 let him not care if he delays his luncheon or dinner, but persist until she
 has told the truth, at least in the main. For it is generally found that,
 after postponements and interruptions, they
 return to their vomit and will not reveal the truth which they began to
 confess, having thought worse of it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And let the Judge take note that, after she has confessed the injuries done to
 men and animals, he shall ask her for how many years she has had an Incubus
 devil, and how long it is since she abjured the faith. For they never confess
 to these matters unless they have first confessed to these matters unless they
 have first confessed their other deeds; therefore they must be asked
 concerning these last of all.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As a fifth precaution, when all the above have failed, let her, if possible,
 be led to some castle; and after she has been kept there under custody for
 some days, let the castellan pretend that he is going on a long journey. And
 then let some of his household, or even some honest women, visit her and
 promise that they will set her entirely at liberty if she will teach them how
 to conduct certain practices. And let the Judge take note that by this means
 they have very often confessed and been convicted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Quite lately a witch was detained in the Castle of Königsheim near the
 town of Schlettstadt in the Diocese of Strasburg, and could not be induced by
 any tortures or questions to confess her crimes. But at last the castellan
 used the method we have just described. Although he was himself present in the
 castle, the witch thought he was away, and three of his household came in to
 her and promised they would set her free if she would teach them how to do
 certain things. At first she refused, saying that they were trying to entrap
 her; but at last she asked what it was that they wanted to know. And one asked
 how to raise a hailstorm, and another asked about carnal matters. When at
 length she agreed to show him how to raise a hailstorm, and a bowl of water
 had been brought in, the witch told him to stir the water with his finger, and
 herself uttered certain words, and suddenly the place which he had named, a
 wood near the castle, was visited by such a tempest and storm of hail as had
 not been seen for many years.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It yet remains to show how the Judge is to proceed in pronouncing sentence in
 a case where all these means have failed, or what is further to be done even
 when she has confessed her crimes, that the whole process may be brought to an
 end; and we shall complete this Last Part of this work with a consideration of
 these matters.

<h2>The Third Head</h2>
<h3>Which is the last Part of this Work. How the Process is to be Concluded by the Pronouncement of a Definite and Just Sentence</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; HAVING by the grace of God
 examined the proper means of arriving at a knowledge of the heresy of
 witchcraft, and having shown how the process on behalf of the faith should be
 initiated and proceeded with, it remains to discuss how that process is to be
 brought to a fitting termination with an appropriate sentence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be noted that this heresy, as was shown in the beginning of this
 Last Part, is not to be confused with other simple heresies, since it is
 obvious that it is not a pure and single crime, but partly ecclesiastical and
 partly civil. Therefore in dealing with the methods of passing sentence, we
 must first consider a certain kind of sentence to which witches are in the
 habit of appealing, in which the secular judge can act on his own account
 independently of the Ordinary. Secondly, we shall consider those in which he
 cannot act without the Ordinary. And so thirdly it will be shown how the
 Ordinaries can discharge themselves of their duties.

</div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question XVII</h2>
<h3>Of Common Purgation, and especially of the Trial of Red-hot Iron, to which Witches Appeal</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE question is now asked whether the secular judge may allow a witch to be
 submitted to a common purgation (concerning which see the Canon 2, q. 4,
 <i>consuluisti</i>, and cap. <i>monomachiam</i>), in the manner in which a
 civil defendant is allowed the trial by ordeal, as, for example, that by
 red-hot iron. And it may seem that he may do so.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For trial by combat is allowable in a criminal case for the protection of
 life, and in a civil case for the protection of property; then wherefore not
 the trial by red-hot iron or boiling water? S. Thomas allows that the former
 is permissible in some cases, when he says in the last article of the
 <i>Second of the Second</i>, q. 95, that a duel is lawful when it appears to
 be consonant with commonsense. Therefore the trial by red-hot iron should also
 be lawful in some cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also it has been used by many Princes of saintly life who have availed
 themselves of the advice and counsel of good men; as, for example, the Sainted
 Emperor Henry in the case of the virgin
 Cunegond whom he had married, who was suspected of adultery.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, a judge, who is responsible for the safety of the community, may
 lawfully allow a smaller evil that a greater may be avoided; as he allows the
 existence of harlots in towns in order to avoid a general confusion of lust.
 For S. Augustine <i>On Free Will</i> says: Take
 away the harlots, and you will create a general chaos and confusion of lust.
 So, when a person has been loaded with insults and injuries by any community,
 he can clear himself of any criminal or civil charge by means of a trial by
 ordeal.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also, since less hurt is caused to the hands by the red-hot iron than is the
 loss of life in a duel, if a duel is permitted where such things are
 customary, much more should the trial by red-hot iron be allowed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But the contrary view is argued where it says (2, q. 5, <i>monomachiam</i>)
 that they who practice such and similar things appear to be tempting God. And
 here the Doctors affirm it must be noted that, according to S. Paul (I.
 <i>Thessalonians</i> v), we must abstain, not only from evil, but from all
 appearance of evil. Therefore the Canon says in that chapter, not that they
 who use such practices tempt God, but that they appear to tempt Him, so that
 it may be understood that, even if a man engage in such a trial with none but
 good intentions, yet since it has the appearance of evil, it is to be
 avoided.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I answer that such tests or trials are unlawful for two reasons. First,
 because their purpose is to judge of hidden matters of which it belongs only
 to God to judge. Secondly, because there is no Divine authority for such
 trials, nor are they anywhere sanctioned in the writings of the Holy Fathers.
 And it says in the chapter consuluisti, 2, q. 5: That which is not sanctioned
 in the writings of the Sainted Fathers is to be presumed superstitious. And Pope Stephen in the same chapter says: It is left
 to your judgement to try prisoners who are convicted by their own confession
 or the proofs of the evidence; but leave that which is hidden and unknown to
 Him Who alone knows the hearts of men.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There is, nevertheless, a difference between a duel and the trial by red-hot
 iron or boiling water. For a duel appears to be more humanly reasonable, the
 combatants being of similar strength and skill, than a trial by red-hot iron.
 For although the purpose of both is to search out something hidden by means of
 a human act; yet in the case of trial by red-hot iron a miraculous effect is
 looked for, whereas this is not so in the case of a duel, in which all that
 can happen is the death of either, or both, of the combatants. Therefore the
 trial by red-hot iron is altogether unlawful; though a duel is not illegal to
 the same extent. So much has been incidentally admitted in respect of duels,
 on account of Princes and secular Judges.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is to be noted that, because of those words of S. Thomas which make the
 above distinction, Nicolas of Lyra, in his Commentary on the duel or combat
 between David and Goliath, I. <i>Regum</i> xvii, tried to prove that in some
 cases a duel is lawful. But Paul of Burgos proves that not this, but rather
 the opposite was the meaning of S. Thomas; and all Princes and secular Judges
 ought to pay particular attention to his proof.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 His first point is that a duel, like the other trial by ordeal, has as its
 purpose the judgement of something hidden, which ought to be left to the
 judgement of God, as we have said. And it cannot be said that this combat of
 David is an authority for duelling; for it was revealed to him by the Lord
 through some inner instinct that he must engage in that combat and avenge upon
 the Philistine the injuries done against God, as is proved by David's words: I
 come against thee in the name of the living God. So he was not properly
 speaking a duellist, but he was an executor of Divine justice.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 His second point is that Judges must especially note that in a duel power, or
 at least licence, is given to each of the parties to kill the other. But since
 one of them is innocent, that power of licence is given for the killing of an
 innocent man; and this is unlawful, as being contrary to the dictates of
 natural law and to the teaching of God. Therefore, a duel is altogether
 unlawful, not only on the part of the appellant and the respondent, but also
 on the part of the Judge and his advisers, who are all equally to be
 considered homicides or parties to manslaughter.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, he points out that a duel is a single combat between two men, the
 purpose of which is that the justice of the case should be made clear by the
 victory of one party, as if by Divine judgement, notwithstanding the fact that
 one of the parties is fighting in an unjust cause; and in this way God is
 tempted. Therefore it is unlawful on the part both of the appellant and the
 respondent. But considering the fact that the judges have other means of
 arriving at an equitable and just termination of the dispute, when they do not
 use such means, but advise or even permit a duel when they could forbid it,
 they are consenting to the death of an innocent person.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since it is unlikely that Nicolas the Commentator was unaware or ignorant
 of the above reasoning, it is concluded that, when he says that in some cases
 a duel can be fought without mortal sin, he is speaking on the part of the
 Judges or advisers, namely, in a case when such a trial is undertaken, not on
 their responsibility or advice, but purely on that of the appellant and
 respondent themselves.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since it is not our purpose to linger over and debate such considerations,
 but to return to the question of witches, it is clear that, if this sort of
 trial is forbidden in the case of other criminal causes, such as theft or
 robbery, still more must it be forbidden in the case of witches who, it is
 agreed, obtain all their power from the devil, whether it be for causing or
 curing an injury, for removing or for preventing an effect of witchcraft.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it is not wonderful witches are able to undergo this trial by ordeal
 unscathed with the help of devils; for we learn from naturalists that if the
 hands be anointed with the juice of a certain herb they are protected from
 burning. Now the devil has an exact knowledge of the virtues of such herbs:
 therefore, although he can cause the hand of the accused to be protected from
 the red-hot iron by invisibly interposing some other substance, yet he can
 procure the same effect by the use of natural objects. Hence even less that
 other criminals ought witches to be allowed this trial by ordeal, because
 their intimate familiarity with the devil; and from the very fact of their
 appealing to this trial they are to be held as suspected witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 An incident illustrative of our argument occurred hardly three years ago in
 the Diocese of Constance. For in the territory of the Counts of Fuerstenberg
 and the Black Forest there was a notorious witch who had been the subject of
 much public complaint. At last, as the result of a general demand, she was
 seized by the Count and accused of various evil works of witchcraft. When she
 was being tortured and questioned, wishing to escape from their hands, she
 appealed to the trial by red-hot iron; and the Count, being you and
 inexperienced, allowed it. And she then carried the red-hot iron not only for
 the stipulated three paces, but for six, and offered to carry it even farther.
 Then, although they ought to have taken this as manifest proof that she was a
 witch (since one of the Saints dared to tempt the help of God in this manner),
 she was released from her chains and lives to the present time, not without
 grave scandal to the Faith in those parts.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question XVIII</h2>
<h3>Of the Manner of Pronouncing a Sentence which is Final and Definitive</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 IN proceeding to treat of those cases in which the secular Judge by himself
 can arrive at a judgement and pronounce a sentence without the co-operation of
 the Diocesan and Ordinaries, we necessarily presuppose that not only is it
 consistent with the protection of the faith and of justice that we Inquisitors
 should be relieved of the duty of passing sentence in these cases, but in the
 same sincerity of spirit we endeavour to relieve the Diocesans also from that
 duty; not in any desire to detract from their authority and jurisdiction, for
 if they should elect to exercise their authority in such matters, it would
 follow that we Inquisitors must also concur in it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It must be remembered, also, that this crime of witches is not purely
 ecclesiastic; therefore the temporal potentates and Lords are not debarred
 from trying and judging it. At the same time was shall show that in some cases
 they must not arrive at a definitive judgement without the authorisation of
 the Diocesans.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But first we must consider the sentence itself: secondly, the nature of its
 pronouncement; and thirdly, in how many ways it is to be pronounced.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 With regard to the first of these questions, S. Augustine says that we must
 not pronounce sentence against any person unless he has been proved guilty, or
 has confessed. Now there are three kinds of sentence - interlocutory,
 definitive, and preceptive. These are explained as follows by S. Raymond. An
 interlocutory sentence is one which is given not on the main issue of the
 case, but on some other side issues which emerge during the hearing of a case;
 such as a decision whether or not a witness is to be disallowed, or whether
 some digression is to be admitted, and such matters as that. Or it may perhaps
 be called interlocutory because it is delivered simply by word of mouth
 without the formality of putting it into writing.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A definitive sentence is one which pronounces a final decision as to the main
 issue of the case.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A preceptive sentence is one which is pronounced by a lower authority on the
 instruction of a higher. But we shall be concerned with the first two of
 these, and especially with the definitive sentence.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now it is laid down by law that a definitive sentence which has been arrived
 at without a due observance of the proper legal procedure in trying a case is
 null and void in law; and the legal conduct of a case consists in two things.
 One concerns the basis of the judgement; for there must be a due provision for
 the hearing of arguments both for the prosecution and the defence, and a
 sentence arrived at without such a hearing cannot stand. The other is not
 concerned with the basis of the judgement, but provides that the sentence must
 not be conditional; for example, a claim for possession should not be decided
 conditionally upon some subsequent claim of property; but where there is no
 question of such an objection the sentence shall stand.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But in the case we are considering, which is a process on behalf of the faith
 against a charge of heresy (though the charge is a mixed one), the procedure
 is straighforward and summary. That is to say, the Judge need not require a
 writ, or demand that the case should be contested. But he must allow
 opportunity for the necessary proofs, and issue his citation, and exact the
 protestation of the oath concerning calumny, etc. Therefore there has lately
 been a new law made as to the method of procedure in such cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To proceed to our second consideration, namely, of the nature of the
 pronouncement of the sentence, it must be noted that it should be pronounced
 by the Judge and no one else, otherwise it is not valid. Also the Judge must
 be sitting in a public and honourable place; and he must pronounce it in the
 day-time and not in the darkness; and there are other conditions to be
 observed; for example, the sentence must not be promulgated upon a Holy Day,
 nor yet merely delivered in writing.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Yet it is to be noted that since, as we have said, this case is conducted in a
 simple and summary manner, it may lawfully be conducted on Holy Days for the
 sake of the convenience of the public, and the Judge may cut short any
 digressions. Therefore the Judge may, if he pleases, act in such a manner, and
 even pass sentence without putting it in writing. For we are authoritatively
 informed that there are cases in which a sentence is valid without its being
 put into writing, as, for example, when such is the custom of any particular
 locality or Court. Also there is excellent precedent for a Bishop, when he is
 the Judge, allowing the sentence to be pronounced by some other person.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Note again that, although in criminal actions the execution of the sentence is
 not to be delayed, this rule does not hold good in four cases, with two of
 which we are here concerned. First, when the prisoner is a pregnant woman; and
 then the sentence shall be delayed until she has given birth. Secondly, when
 the prisoner has confessed her crime, but has afterwards denied it again: that
 is to say, when the way which we explained in the Fourteenth Question.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now before we proceed to our third consideration, namely, the different
 methods of passing sentence which we shall proceed to treat of up to the end
 of this work, we must first make some remarks about the various ways in which
 a prisoner is rendered suspect, from which the various methods of passing
 sentence follow as a consequence.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question XIX</h2>
<h3>Of the Various Degrees of Overt Suspicion which render the Accused liable to be Sentenced</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 BOTH the old and the new legislature provide an answer to the question as to
 in how many and what ways a person can be held suspect of heresy or any other
 crime, and whether they can be judged and sentenced by reason of such
 suspicions. For the gloss on the chapter <i>nos in quemquam</i>, which we
 quoted in the last Question, says that there are four means of convicting a
 prisoner: either by the depositions of witnesses in Court, or by the evidence
 of the facts, or by reason of previous convictions against the prisoner, or
 because of a grave suspicion.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the Canonists note that suspicion is of three kinds. The first of which
 the Canon says, “You shall not judge anyone because he is suspect in your
 own opinion.” The second is Probably; and this, but not the first, leads
 to a purgation. The third is Grave, and leads to a conviction; and S. Jerome
 understands this kind of suspicion when he says that a wife may be divorced
 either for fornication or for a reasonably suspected fornication.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It must further be noted that the second, or highly probable and
 circumstantial, suspicion is admitted as a kind of half-proof; that is to say,
 it helps to substantiate other proofs. Therefore it can also lead to a
 judgement, and not only to a purgation. And as for the grave suspicion, which
 suffices for a conviction, note that it is of two kinds. One is of the law and
 by the law, as when the law fixes and determines some point against which no
 proof can be admitted. For example, if a man has given a woman a promise of
 matrimony, and copulation has ensued, then matrimony is presumed, and no proof
 to the contrary is admitted. The second is of the law but not by the law, as
 where the law presumes but does not determine a fact. For example, if a man
 has lived for a long time with a woman, she is presumed to have had connexion
 with him; but against this proofs are admitted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Applying this to our discussion of the heresy of witches and to the modern
 laws, we say that in law there are three degrees of suspicion in the matter of
 heresy: the first slight, the second great, and the third very great.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The first is in law called a light suspicion. Of this it is said in the
 chapter <i>Accusatus, de Haeret</i>. Lib. 6: If the accused has incurred only
 a light and small suspicion, and if she should again fall under that
 suspicion, although she is to be severely punished for this, she ought not to
 suffer the punishment of those who have relapsed into heresy. And this
 suspicion is called small or light, both because it can be removed by a small
 and light defence, and because it arises from small and light conjectures.
 Therefore it is called small, because of the small proofs of it; and light,
 because of the light conjectures.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As an example of simple heresy, if people are found to be meeting together
 secretly for the purpose of worship, or differing in their manner of life and
 behaviour from the usual habits of the faithful; or if they meet together in
 sheds and barns, or at the more Holy Seasons in the remoter fields or woods,
 by day or by night, or are in any way found to separate themselves and not to
 attend Mass at the usual times or in the usual manner, or form secret
 friendships with suspected witches: such people incur at least a light
 suspicion of heresy, because it is proved that heretics often act in this
 manner. And of this light suspicion the Canon says: They who are by a slight
 argument discovered to have deviated from the teaching and path of the
 Catholic religion are not to be classed as heretics, nor is a sentence to be
 pronounced against them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Henry of Segusio agrees with this in his <i>Summa; de Praesumptione</i>, where
 he says: It is to be noted that although a heretic be convicted by a slight
 argument of that matter of which he is suspected, he is not on that account to
 be considered a heretic; and he proves it by the above reasoning.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second or grave suspicion is in law called grave or vehement, and of this
 the above Canon (<i>Accusatus</i>) again says: One who is accused or suspected
 of heresy, against whom a grave or vehement suspicion of this crime has
 arisen, etc. And it goes on: And these are not two kinds but the same kind of
 suspicion. Giovanni d’Andrea also says: Vehement is the same as strong, as the
 Archdeacon says speaking of this Canon. Also Bernardus
 Papiensis and Huguccio say that vehement is
 the same as strong or great. S. Gregory also, in the First Book of his
 <i>Morals</i> says: A vehement wind sprang up. Therefore we say that anyone
 has a vehement case when he has a strong one. So much for this.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore a great suspicion is called vehement or strong; and it is so called
 because it is dispelled only by a vehement and strong defence, and because it
 arises from great, vehement, and strong conjectures, arguments, and evidence.
 As, to take an example of simple heresy, when people are found to shelter
 known heretics, and show favour to them, or visit and associate with them and
 give gifts to them, receive them into their houses and protect them, and such
 like: such people are vehemently suspected of heresy. And similarly in the
 heresy of witches, they are brought under suspicion when they share in the
 crimes of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And here are especially to be noted those men or women who cherish some
 inordinate love or excessive hatred, even if they do not use to work any harm
 against men or animals in other ways. For, as we have said, those who behave
 in this way in any heresy are strongly to be suspected. And this is shown by
 the Canon where it says that there is no doubt that such persons act in this
 way out of some heretical sympathy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third and greatest suspicion is in law called grave or violent: for the
 Canon and the glosses of the Archdeacon and Giovanni d’Andrea explain that the
 word vehement does not mean the same as the word violent. And of this
 suspicion the Canon says (dist. 34): This presumption or suspicion is called
 violent because it violently constrains and compels a Judge to believe it, and
 cannot be cast off by any evasion; and also because it arises from violent and
 convincing conjectures.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For example, in simple heresy, if persons are found to show a reverent love
 for heretics, to receive consolation or communion from them, or perpetrate any
 other such matter in accordance with their rites and ceremonies: such persons
 would fall under and be convicted of a violent suspicion of heresy and
 heretical beliefs. (See many chapters on this subject in Book VI of the
 Canon.) For there is no doubt that such persons act in this way out of a
 belief in some heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is the same, as regards the heresy of witches, with those who perform and
 persist in performing any of the actions which pertain to the rites of
 witches. Now these are of various kinds. Sometimes it is only some threatening
 speech, such as “You shall soon feel what will happen to you,” or
 something similar. Sometimes it is a touch, just laying their hands curiously
 on a man or a beast. Sometimes it is only a matter of being seen, when they
 show themselves by day or by night to others who are sleeping in their beds;
 and this they do when they wish to bewitch men or beasts. But for raising
 hailstorms they observe various other methods and ceremonies, and perform
 various ritual actions round about a river, as we have shown before where we
 discussed the manner and methods of working witchcraft. When such are found
 and are publicly notorious they are convicted of a violent suspicion of the
 heresy of witchcraft; especially when some effect of witchcraft has followed
 upon their actions, either immediately or after some interval. For then there
 is direct evidence when any instruments of witchcraft are found hidden in some
 place. And although when some interval of time has elapsed the evidence of the
 fact is not so strong, such a person still remains under strong suspicion of
 witchcraft, and therefore much more of simple heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if it be asked whether the devil cannot inflict injury upon men and beasts
 without the means of a woman being seen in a vision or by her touch, we answer
 that he can, when God permits it. But the permission of God is more readily
 granted in the case of a creature that was dedicated to God, but by denying
 the faith has consented to other horrible crimes; and therefore the devil more
 often uses such means to harm creatures. Further, we may say that, although
 the devil can work without a witch, he yet very much prefers to work with one,
 for the many reasons which we showed earlier in this work.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To sum up our conclusions on this matter, it is to be said that, following the
 above distinctions, those who are suspected of the heresy of witchcraft are
 separated into three categories, since some are lightly, some strongly, and
 some gravely suspected. And they are lightly suspected who act in such a way as
 to give rise to a small or light suspicion against hem of this heresy. And
 although, as has been said, a person who is found to be suspected in this way
 is not to be branded as a heretic, yet he must undergo a canonical purgation,
 or he must be caused to pronounce a solemn abjuration as in the case of one
 convicted of a slight heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For the Canon (cap. <i>excommunicamus</i>) says: Those who have been found to
 rest under a probable suspicion (that is, says Henry of Segusio, a light
 suspicion), unless, having respect to the nature of the suspicion and the
 quality of their persons, they should prove their innocent by a fitting
 purgation, they are to be stricken with the sword of anathema as a worthy
 satisfaction in the sight of all men. And if they continue obstinate in their
 excommunication for the period of a year, they are to utterly condemned as
 heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And note that, in the purgation imposed upon them, whether or not they consent
 to it, and whether or not they fail in it, they are throughout to be judged as
 reputed heretics on whom a canonical purgation is to be imposed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And that a person under this light suspicion can and should be caused to
 pronounce a solemn abjuration is shown in the chapter <i>Accusatus</i>, where
 it says: A person accused or suspected of heresy, against whom there is a
 strong suspicion of this crime, if he abjures the heresy before the Judge and
 afterwards commits it, then, by a sort of legal fiction, he shall be judged to
 have relapsed into heresy, although the heresy was not proved against him
 before his abjuration. But if the suspicion was in the first place a small or
 light one, although such a relapse renders the accused liable to severe
 punishment, yet he is not to suffer the punishment of those who relapse into
 heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But those who are strongly suspected, that is, those who have acted in such a
 way as to engender a great and strong suspicion; even those are not
 necessarily heretics or to be condemned as such. For it is expressly stated in
 the Canon that no one is to be condemned of so great a crime by reason of a
 strong suspicion. And it says:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore we order that, when the accused is only under suspicion, even if it
 be a strong one, we do not wish him to be condemned of so grave a crime; but
 such a one so strongly suspected must be commanded to abjure all heresy in
 general, and in particular that of which he is strongly suspected.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he afterwards relapses either into his former heresy or into any other,
 or if he associates with those whom he knows to be witches or heretics, or
 visits them, receives, consults with, forgives, or favours them, he shall not
 escape the punishment of backsliders, according to the chapter
 <i>Accusatus</i>. For it says there: He who has been involved in one kind or
 sect of heresy, or has erred in one article of the faith or sacrament of the
 Church, and has afterwards specifically and generally abjured his heresy: if
 thereafter he follows another kind or sect of heresy, or errs in another
 article or sacrament of the Church, it is our will that he be judged a
 backslider. He, therefore, who is known to have lapsed into heresy before his
 abjuration, if after his abjuration he receives heretics, visits them, gives
 or sends them presents or gifts, or shows favour to them, etc., he is worthily
 and truly to judged a backslider; for by this proof there is no doubt that he
 was in the first place guilty. Such is the tenor of the Canon.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 From these words it is clear that there are three cases in which a person
 under strong suspicion of heresy shall, after his abjuration, be punished as a
 backslider. The first is when he falls back into the same heresy of which he
 was strongly suspected. The second is when he has abjured al heresy in
 general, and yet lapses into another heresy, even if he has never before been
 suspected or accused of that heresy. The third is when he receives and shows
 favour to heretics. And this last comprises and embraces many cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it is asked what should be done when a person who has fallen under so
 strong a suspicion steadily refuses to comply with his Judge’s order to abjure
 his heresy: is he to be at once handed over to the secular Court to be
 punished? We answer that by no means must this be done; for the Canon (<i>ad
 abolendam</i>) expressly speaks, not of suspects, but of those who are
 manifestly taken in heresy. And more rigorous action is to be employed against
 those who are manifestly taken than against those who are only suspected.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if it is asked, How then is such a one to be proceeded against? We answer
 that the Judge must proceed against him in accordance with the chapter
 <i>excommunicamus</i>, and he must be excommunicated. And if he continues
 obstinate after a year’s excommunication, he is to be condemned as a
 heretic.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 There are others again who are violently or gravely suspected, whose actions
 give rise to a violent suspicion against them; and such a one is to be
 considered as a heretic, and throughout he is to be treated as if he were
 taken in heresy, in accordance with the Canon Law. For these either confess
 their crime or not; and if they do, and wish to return to the faith and abjure
 their heresy, they are to be received back into penitence. But if they refuse
 to abjure, they are to be handed over to the secular Court for punishment.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he does not confess his crime after he has been convicted, and does not
 consent to abjure his heresy, he is to be condemned as an impenitent heretic.
 For a violent suspicion is sufficient to warrant a conviction, and admits no
 proof to the contrary.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now this discussion deals with simple heresy, where there is no direct or
 indirect evidence of the fact, as will be shown in the sixth method of passing
 sentence, where a man is to be condemned as a heretic even though he may not
 actually be one: then how much more is it applicable to the heresy of witches,
 where there is always in addition either the direct evidence of bewitched
 children, men, or animals, or the indirect evidence of instruments of
 witchcraft which have been found.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And although in the case of simple heresy those who are penitent and abjure
 are, as has been said, admitted to penitence and imprisonment for life; yet in
 this heresy, although the ecclesiastic Judge may receive the prisoner into
 penitence, yet the civil Judge can, because of her temporal injuries, that is
 to say, the harms she has done to men, cattle, and goods, punish her with
 death; nor can the ecclesiastic Judge prevent this, for even if he does not
 hand her over to be punished, yet he is compelled to deliver her up at the
 request of the civil Judge.<br/>

<h2>Question XX</h2>
<h3>Of the Firth Method of Pronouncing Sentence</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 SINCE, therefore, the accused is either found innocent and is to be altogether
 absolved, or is found only to be generally defamed as a heretic, or is found a
 proper subject for the questions and the torture on account of her reputation,
 or is found to be lightly suspected of heresy, or is found to be strongly or
 gravely suspected of heresy, or is found to be at the same time commonly
 defamed and suspected of heresy, or is found to have confessed her heresy and
 to be penitent but probably to have relapsed, or is found to have confessed
 her heresy and to be impenitent but not really to have relapsed, or is found
 to have confessed but by legitimate witnesses and otherwise legally to have
 been convicted of heresy, or is found to have been convicted of heresy but to
 have escaped or defiantly absented herself, or is found not to have done
 injury by witchcraft but to have removed bewitchments unfittingly and by
 unlawful means, or is found to be an archer-wizard or enchanter of weapons
 with the purpose of causing death, or is found to be a witch-midwife offerings
 infants to the devil in the manner of an enemy, or is found to make frivolous
 and fraudulent appeals with a view to saving her life:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore, if she is found to be entirely innocent, the final sentence shall
 be pronounced in the following manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be noted that the accused is found to be entirely innocent when,
 after the facts of the process have been diligently discussed in consultation
 with skilled lawyers, she cannot be convicted either by her own confession, or
 by the evidence of the fact, or by the production of legitimate witnesses
 (since they have disagreed upon the main issue); and when the accused has
 never before been suspected of or publicly defamed as regards that crime (but
 the case is different if she has been defamed as regards some other crime);
 and when there is no evidence of the fact against her. In such a case the
 following procedure is observed; for she is to be absolved by the Bishop or
 Judge by a sentence to the following effect:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a town (or Judge, etc.), considering
 that you N. of such a place and such a Diocese have been accused before us of
 the crime of heresy and namely of witchcraft; and considering that this
 accusation was such as we could not pass over with connivent eyes, have
 condescended to inquire whether the aforesaid accusation can be substantiated
 as true, by calling witnesses, by examining you, and by using other means
 which are fitting according to the canonical sanctions. Wherefore having
 diligently seen and examined all that has been done and said in this case, and
 having had the counsel of learned lawyers and Theologians, and having
 repeatedly examined and inquired into all; sitting as Judges on this tribunal
 and having only God before our eyes and the truth of the case, and the Holy
 Gospels being placed before us that our judgement may proceed from the
 countenance of God and our eyes behold equity, we proceed to our definitive
 sentence in this way, invoking the name of Christ. Since by that which we have
 seen and heard, and has been produced, offered, done, and executed before us
 in this present case, we have not found that anything has legally been proved
 against you of those things of which you were accused before us, we pronounce,
 declare, and give it as our final sentence that no act has legally been proved
 to us against you by which you can or ought to be judged a heretic or witch of
 heresy. Wherefore by this present declaration, inquiry, and judgement, we
 freely discharge you. This sentence was given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let care be taken not to put anywhere in the sentence that the accused is
 innocent or immune, but that it was not legally proved against him; for if
 after a little time he should again be brought to trial, and it should be
 legally proved, he can, notwithstanding the previous sentence of absolution,
 then be condemned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Note also that the same method of absolution may be used in the case of one
 who is accused of receiving, protecting, or otherwise comforting and favouring
 heretics, when nothing is legally proved against him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 A secular Judge commissioned by the Bishop shall use his own manner of
 pronouncement.

<h2>Question XXI</h2>
<h3>Of the Second Method of Pronouncing Sentence, when the Accused is no more than Defamed</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE second method of delivering judgement is to be employed when he or she who
 is accused, after a diligent discussion of the merits of the case in
 consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be no more than defamed as a
 heretic in some village, town, or province. And this is when the accused does
 not stand convicted either by her own confession, or by the evidence of the
 facts, or by the legitimate production of witnesses; nor has there been
 anything proved against her except that she is the subject of common
 aspersion: so that no particular act of witchcraft can be proved by which she
 can be brought under strong or grave suspicion, as that she has uttered
 threatening words, for example, “You will soon feel what will happen to
 you,” or something to that effect, and afterwards some injury has
 befallen the person or the cattle of the man she threatened.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The following procedure, therefore, is to be employed in the case of such a
 one against whom nothing has been proved except public obloquy. In this case
 judgement cannot be delivered for the accused, nor can she be absolved as in
 the first method; but a canonical purgation must be imposed upon her.
 Therefore let the Bishop or his deputy, or the Judge, first take note that, in
 a case of heresy, it is not necessary that a person should be defamed only by
 good and respected people; for the calumniation uttered by common and simple
 folk carries equal weight.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the reason for this is, that the same persons who are admitted as accusers
 in a case of heresy are also admitted as detractors. Now any heretic can be
 accused by anybody, except his mortal enemies; therefore he can also be
 defamed by anybody.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore let the Bishop or Judge pronounce his sentence of canonical
 purgation in this or some similar manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a city, or Judge of such a county,
 having diligently examined the merits of the process conducted by us against
 you N. of such a Diocese accused before us of the crime of heresy, etc. We
 have not found that you have confessed to or have been convicted of the
 aforesaid sin or that you are even lightly suspected of it, except that we
 find that truly and legitimately you are publicly defamed by both good and bad
 in such a village, town, or Diocese; and that you may be in good odour among
 the company of the faithful we impose upon you as by law a canonical
 purgation, assigning to you such a day of such a month at such hour of the
 day, upon which you shall appear in person before us with so many persons of
 equal station with you to purge you of your defamation. Which sponsors must be
 men of the Catholic faith and of good life who have known your habits and
 manner of living not only recently but in time past. And we signify that, if
 you should fail in this purgation, we shall hold you convicted, according to
 the canonical sanctions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be considered that, when a person is duly found to be publicly
 defamed of some heresy, and nothing is proved against him except that
 defamation, a canonical purgation shall be imposed upon him. That is, he must
 produce some seven, ten, twenty, or thirty men, according to the extent to
 which he has been defamed and the size and important of the place concerned,
 and these must be men of his own station and condition. For example, if he who
 is defamed is a religious, they must be religious; if he is a secular, they
 must be seculars; if he be a solder, they must be soldiers who purge him from
 the crime for which he is defamed. And these sponsors must be men professing
 the Catholic faith and of good life, who have known his habits and life both
 recently and for a long time.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he refuses this purgation, he must be excommunicated; and if he remains
 obstinate in that excommunication for a year, he is then to be condemned as a
 heretic.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if he accepts the purgation and fails in it; that is, if he cannot find
 sponsors of the number and quality desired; he shall be considered as
 convicted, and is to be condemned as a heretic.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And it must here be remarked that, when it is said that he must purge himself
 by means of so many men of his own station in life, this is meant generically
 and not specifically. Thus, if a Bishop is to be purged, it is not necessary
 that all his sponsors should be Bishops; but Abbots and other religious who
 are priests are admitted; and similarly in other cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the defamed person shall purge himself in the following manner. At the
 time assigned to him for his canonical purgation, he shall appear in person
 with his sponsors before the Bishop who is his Judge, in the place where he is
 known to be defamed; and, placing his hand upon the Book of the Gospels set
 before him, he shall say as follows:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I swear upon these four Holy Gospels of God that I never held, believed or
 taught, neither do I hold or believe such heresy (naming it) for which I am
 defamed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 That is to say, he shall deny on oath whatever it is for which he is
 defamed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 After this, all his sponsors shall place their hands on the Gospels; and each
 of them severally shall say: And I swear upon this Holy Gospel of God that I
 believe him to have sworn the truth. And then he is canonically purged.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is also to be noted that a person defamed of heresy is to be purged in the
 place where he is known to be defamed. And if he has been defamed in many
 places, he must be required to profess the Catholic faith and deny the heresy
 in all the places in which he is known as defamed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And let not such a person hold in light esteem this canonical purgation. For
 it is provided by the Canon Law that, if he afterwards falls into the heresy
 of which he has been purged, he is to be handed over as a backslider to the
 secular Court. But the case is somewhat different if he falls into some other
 heresy, of which he has not before been purged.<br/>

<h2>Question XXII</h2>
<h3>Of the Third Kind of Sentence, to be Pronounced on one who is Defamed, and who is to be put to the Question</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE Third method of bringing a process on behalf of the faith to
 a conclusive termination is when the person accused of heresy,
 after a careful consideration of the merits of the process in
 consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be inconsistent in
 his statements, or is found that there are sufficient grounds to
 warrant his exposure to the question and torture: so that if,
 after he has been thus questioned, he confesses nothing, he may
 be considered innocent. And this is when the prisoner has not
 been taken in heresy, nor has he been convicted by his own
 confession, or by the evidence of the facts, or by the legitimate
 production of witnesses, and there are no indications that he is
 under such a suspicion as to warrant his being made to abjure the
 heresy; but nevertheless he is inconsistent in his answers when
 interrogated. Or there may be other sufficient reasons for
 exposing him to torture. And in such a case the following
 procedure is to be observed.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And because such a judgement in includes an interlocutory
 sentence which must be against and not for the prisoner, the
 Inquisitor must not divide it into two sentences, but include it
 all in one. And in the first place, if the accused remains firm
 in his denials and can in no way be induced by honest men to
 confess the truth, the following manner of sentence, which is in
 some respects definitive, shall be used.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a town, or Judge in the
 territory subject to the rule of such a Prince, having regard to
 the merits of the process conducted by us against you N., of such
 a place in such a Diocese, and after careful examination, find
 that you are not consistent in your answers, and that there are
 sufficient indications besides that you ought to be exposed to
 the question and torture. Therefore, that the truth may be known
 from your own mouth and that from henceforth you may not offend
 the ears of your Judges with your equivocations, we declare,
 pronounce, and give sentence that on this present day at such an
 hour you are to be subjected to an interrogatory under torture.
 This sentence was given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 If the person to be questioned is both found to be equivocal and
 at the same time there are other indications sufficient to
 warrant his being tortured, let both these facts be included in
 the sentence, as they are above. But if only one or the other of
 these hold good, let that one only be put in the sentence. But
 let the sentence be soon put into execution, or let them make as
 if to execute it. Nevertheless let not the Judge be too willing
 to subject a person to torture, for this should only be resorted
 to in default of other proofs. Therefore let him seek for other
 proofs; and if he cannot find them, and thinks it probable that
 the accused is guilty, but denied the truth out of fear, let him
 use other approved methods, always with due precautions, and by
 using the persuasions of the friends of the accused do his utmost
 to extract the truth from his own lips. And let him not hasten
 the business; for very often meditation, and the ordeal of
 imprisonment, and the repeated persuasion of honest men will
 induce the accused to discover the truth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; But if, after keeping the accused in
 suspense, and after due and decent postponements of the time, and
 many exhortations of the accused, the Bishop and the Judge are
 well persuaded that, all circumstances considered, the accused is
 denying the truth, let them torture him slightly, without
 shedding blood, bearing in mind that torture is often fallacious
 and ineffective. For some are so soft-hearted and feeble-minded
 that at the least torture they will confess anything, whether it
 be true or not. Others are so stubborn that, however much they
 are tortured, the truth is not to be had from them. There are
 others who, having been tortured before, are the better able to
 endure it a second time, since their arms have been accomodated
 to the stretchings and twistings involved; whereas the effect on
 others is to make them weaker, so that they can the less easily
 endure torture. Others are bewitched, and make use of the fact in
 their torture, so that they will die before the will confess
 anything; for they become, as it were, insensible to pain.
 Therefore there is need for much prudence in the matter of
 torture, and the greatest attention is to be given to the
 condition of the person who is to be tortured.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 When, then, the sentence has been pronounced, the officers shall
 without delay prepare to torture the accused. And while they are
 making their preparations, the Bishop or Judge shall use his own
 persuasions and those of other honest men zealous for the faith
 to induce the accused to confess the truth freely, if necessary
 promising to spare his life, as we have shown above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if the accused cannot thus be terrified into telling the
 truth, a second or third day may be appointed for the
 continuation of the torture; but it must not be repeated then and
 there. For such a repetition is not permissible unless some
 further indications against the accused should transpire. But
 there is nothing to prevent a continuation of the torture on
 another day.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Let it be said: We N. Bishop and N.
 Judge (if he is present) aforesaid, assign to you N. such a day
 for the continuation of the torture, that the truth may be known
 from your own mouth. And let all be set down in the process. And
 during the interval appointed to him, let them use their own
 persuasions and those of other honest men to induce him to
 confess the truth.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he has refused to confess, the torture can be continued on
 the day assigned, more or less severely according to the gravity
 of the offences in question. And the Judges will be able to
 observe many lawful precautions, both in word and deed, by which
 they may come at the truth; but these are more easily learned by
 use and experience and the variety of different cases than by the
 art of teaching of anyone.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if, after having been fittingly questioned and tortured, he
 will not discover the truth, let him not be further molested, but
 be freely allowed to depart. If, however, he confesses, and
 abides by his confession, and uncovers the truth, acknowledging
 his guilt and asking the pardon of the Church; then according to
 the Canon <i>ad abolendam</i> he is to be treated as one taken in
 heresy on his own confession, but penitent, and he must abjure
 the heresy, and sentence must be pronounced against him as in the
 case of those who are convicted by their own confession as being
 taken in heresy. This will be explained in the eighth method of
 sentencing such, to which the reader may refer.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 If, on the other hand, he confesses the truth, but is not
 penitent but obstinately persists in his heresy, but is not a
 relapsed heretic, then according to the Canon, after a decent
 interval and due warning, he is to be condemned as a heretic and
 handed over to the secular Court to suffer the extreme penalty,
 as we show later in the tenth method. But if he is a relapsed
 heretic, he is to be condemned in the way which is again
 explained in the tenth method, to which the reader may refer.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But here it must be particularly noted that in some instances he
 who is to be questioned confesses nothing against himself before
 the torture, nor is anything proved on the strength of which he
 can be required to abjure the heresy or be condemned as a
 heretic; and in such cases the above procedure should be adopted,
 as we have said, immediately. But in other cases the accused is
 taken in heresy, or he is to be considered either lightly or
 strongly suspected; and he is not to be tortured in respect of
 such matters; but if, apart from these, he denies some points
 which are not proved, but of which there is sufficient indication
 to warrant his being tortured; and if, having been questioned as
 to these under torture, he confesses to none of them, he is not
 on that account to be absolved in accordance with the first
 method; but he must be proceeded against according to that which
 has been proved against him, and he or she must abjure the heresy
 as being one under suspicion of or taken in heresy, as the merits
 of the process may exact or require. And if, after torture, he
 confesses all or part of that for which he was tortured, then he
 must abjure both this and the former heresy which was proved
 against him, and sentence must be pronounced against him in
 respect of both of these.

<h2>Question XXIII</h2>
<h3>The Fourth Method of Sentencing, in the Case of one Accused upon a Light Suspicion</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE fourth method of concluding the process on behalf of the faith is used
 when, after the merits of the process have been diligently examined in
 consultation with expert lawyers, the accused is found to rest under only a
 light suspicion of heresy. And this is when the accused is not taken in
 heresy, nor is convicted by her own confession or by the evidence of the facts
 or by the legitimate production of witnesses, and there are no other strong or
 vehement indications of heresy against her; but only a small and light
 indications of such a sort as, in the opinion of the Court, to engender a
 light suspicion against her. And such a one must be required to abjure the
 heresy of which she is accused; and then, if she relapses into heresy, she is
 not liable to the punishment of backsliders, although she must be more
 severely punished than would be the case if she had not previously abjured the
 heresy (see the Canon c. <i>accusatus</i>). The following procedure shall be
 followed in such a case. For such an accused, if the matter be a public one,
 will publicly make the following abjuration in the Church:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I, N., of such a Diocese, a citizen of such a city or place, being on my
 trial, do swear before you the Lord Bishop of such a city, and upon the Holy
 Gospels placed before me and upon which I set my hand, that I believe in my
 heart and profess with my lips that Holy Catholic and Apostolic Faith which
 the Holy Roman Church believes, confesses, preaches, and observes. Also I
 swear that I believe in my heart and profess with my lips that the Lord JESUS
 Christ, in company with all the Saints, abominates the wicked heresy of
 witches; and that all who follow or adhere to it will with the devil and his
 Angels be punished in eternal fire unless they turn their hearts and are
 reconciled by the penitence of the Holy Church. And there I abjure, renounce,
 and revoke that heresy of which you, my Lord Bishop, and your Officers hold me
 suspected: namely, that I have been familiar with witches, have ignorantly
 defended their errors, have held in detestation their Inquisitors and
 prosecutors, or that I have failed to bring their crimes to light. Also I
 swear that I have never believed the aforesaid heresy, nor do I believe, nor
 have I adhered, nor do I adhered to it, nor shall I ever believe, adhere to,
 or teach it, nor do I intend to teach it. And if I should hereafter be guilty
 of any of the aforesaid practices (which God forbid), I shall willingly submit
 myself to the punishment provided by law for such who are so forsworn; and I
 am ready to undergo any penance which you see fit to enjoin me for those words
 or deeds of mine for which you hold me deservedly suspect; and I swear to
 fulfill such penance to the best of my strength, and to omit no part of it, so
 help me God and these Holy Gospels.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The above abjuration shall be made in the common speech, so that all may
 understand it. And when it is done, the Judge, if he is present, or his deputy
 shall speak to her in the common speech to the following effect:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 My son (or daughter), you have not unworthily abjured the suspicion which we
 entertained of you, and have purged yourself by the aforesaid abjuration.
 Beware then lest hereafter you fall into the heresy you have abjured. For
 although, if you should repent, you would not be delivered up to the secular
 Court, since you made your abjuration as one under a light, and not a strong,
 suspicion, yet you wold then be far more severely punished than you would have
 been if you had not abjured, and you would then rest under a strong instead of
 a light suspicion. And when you should abjure as such, and afterwards should
 relapse, you would suffer the due punishment of a backslider, and would
 without mercy be delivered to the secular Court to endure the extreme
 penalty.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if she makes her abjuration secretly in the chamber of the Bishop or
 Judge, which will be the case when the matter is not a public one, she shall
 abjure in the same manner. And afterwards sentence shall be pronounced as
 follows:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, by the mercy of God Bishop of such a city, or (if he is present) Judge in
 the territory subject to such a Prince, having carefully seen and examined the
 merits of the process conducted by us against you N., accused before us
 heresy, find that you have committed such and such (naming them) which render
 you lightly suspected of heresy, on account of which we have judged it proper
 to cause you to abjure that heresy as one lightly suspected of it. But not for
 that can you be dismissed unpunished. And that you may become more careful in
 the future, having consulted with many eminent persons learned in the law and
 with religious men, and having carefully weighed and digested the whole
 matter, having only God before our eyes, and the irrefragable truth of the
 Holy Catholic Faith, and with the Holy Gospels placed before us that our
 sentence may proceed as from God’s countenance and that our eyes may see with
 equity, and sitting in tribunal as Judge, we condemn, sentence, or rather
 impose penance upon you N., standing in person here in our presence, in the
 following manner. Namely, that never hereafter shall you knowingly hold to,
 associate with, defend in your speech, read (if you are well learned), or
 hereafter, etc. and let there be set down that which she has committed, on
 account of which she was held suspected of the crime of heresy. This sentence
 and penance were given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And let the Notary take care that he sets it down in the process that such
 abjuration was made as by one under a light, not a strong, suspicion of
 heresy; for otherwise great danger might ensue.<br/>

<h2>Question XXIV</h2>
<h3>The Fifth Manner of Sentence, in the Case of one under Strong Suspicion</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE fifth method of concluding a process on behalf of the faith
 is used when she who is accused of heresy, after a careful
 examination of the merits of the process in consultation with
 learned lawyers, is found to be strongly suspected of heresy. And
 this is when the accused is not legally taken in heresy, nor has
 been convicted by her own confession or by the evidence of the
 facts or by the legitimate production of witnesses; but strong
 and weighty indications have been proved against her by reason of
 which she is held to be under strong suspicion of heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The procedure in such a case is as follows. For such a person
 should abjure that heresy as one strongly suspected of it, in
 such a manner that, if she should afterwards relapse, she must be
 delivered to the secular Court to suffer the extreme penalty. And
 she shall make her abjuration publicly or secretly according to
 whether she is publicly or secretly suspected, or by more or
 less, high or low, as was just said in the case of one under a
 light suspicion; and she must abjure that specific heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the preparations for such an abjuration should be as follows:
 - When the Sunday comes which has been fixed for the abjuration
 and the hearing of the sentence or the imposition of the penance,
 the preacher shall deliver a general sermon. After this, the
 Notary or clerk shall publicly read out the crimes of which the
 accused has been convicted, and those of which she is strongly
 suspected as a heretic.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Then the Judge or his deputy shall say to her: Behold! according
 to that which has been read you are strongly suspected by us of
 such heresy; wherefore it behoves you to purge yourself and
 abjure the aforesaid heresy. And then the Book of the Gospels
 shall be placed before her, and she shall set her hand upon it;
 and if she can read competently, she shall be given the following
 written abjuration, and shall read it in the presence of the
 whole congregation.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if she cannot read competently, the Notary shall read it
 phrase by phrase, and the accused shall repeat it in a loud and
 audible voice in the following manner. The Notary or clerk shall
 say: I, N., of such a place, and the accused person shall repeat
 after him the same words, but always in the vulgar tongue. And so
 on up to the end of the abjuration. And she shall abjure in the
 following manner.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, standing my trial in
 person in presence of you reverend Lords the Bishop of such city
 and the Judge of the territory subject to the rule of such a
 Lord, upon the Holy Gospels set before me and touched by my
 hands, I swear that I believe in my heart and profess with my
 lips that Holy Catholic and Apostolic Faith which the Holy Roman
 Church teaches, professes, preaches, and holds. Also I swear that
 I believe in my heart and profess with my lips that, etc. And let
 her pronounce the Catholic article of the faith against that
 heresy of which she is strongly suspected.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For example, if the heresy of witchcraft is in question, let her
 say as follows:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I swear that I believe that not only will simple heretics and
 schismatics be tortured in fire everlasting, but that those above
 all will be so punished who are infected with the heresy of
 witches, who deny before the devil that faith which they received
 in Holy Baptism at the font, and practise demoniac lewdness for
 the fulfilment of their evil desires, inflicting all sorts of
 injuries upon men and animals and the fruits of the earth. And
 consequently I abjure, renounce, and revoke that heresy, or
 rather infidelity, which falsely and mendaciously maintains that
 there are no witches in the world, and that no one ought to
 believe that those injuries can be caused with the help of
 devils; for such infidelity is, as I now recognize, expressly
 contrary to the decision of our Holy Mother the Church and of all
 the Catholic Doctors, as also against the Imperial laws which
 have decreed that witches are to be burned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also I swear that I have never persistently believed in the
 aforesaid heresy, neither do I believe nor adhere to it at the
 present, nor have I taught it, not intend to teach it, nor shall
 teach it. Also I swear and promise that I will never do or cause
 to be done such and such (naming them) of which you hold me
 strongly suspected as a heretic. And if hereafter (which God
 forbid) I should do any of the aforesaid, I am ready the undergo
 the punishment provided by law for backsliders; and I am ready to
 submit myself to any penance which you decide to impose upon me
 for those deeds and words of mine for which you hold me strongly
 suspected of the said heresy. And I swear and promise that I will
 perform it to the best of my strength, and will omit no part of
 it, so God and this Holy Gospel help me.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And the said abjuration shall be made in the vulgar tongue so
 that it may be understood by all, unless it be made only in the
 presence of Clerics with a competent knowledge of the Latin
 tongue. But if the abjuration be made secretly in the Bishop's
 palace or chamber, when it is not a public matter, it shall be
 made in a similar manner. And afterwards the Bishop shall
 admonish her as above to beware lest she relapse and incur the
 penalty of a backslider. And let the Notary take care that he set
 it down how such abjuration was made by such a person as one
 strongly suspected of heresy, so that, if she should relapse, she
 may be punished as is proper for a backslider.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And when this has been done, let the sentence or penance be
 pronounced in the following manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, N., Bishop of such city, and Brother N. (if he is present),
 Inquisitor of the sin of heresy in the domains subject to the
 rule of such a Prince, especially deputed by the Holy Apostolic
 See: having in mind that you, N., of such a place in such a
 Diocese, have done such and such (naming them), as lawfully
 appears from the carefully examined merits of the process,
 wherefore we reasonably hold you strongly suspected of such
 heresy, and have caused you to abjure it as one so suspected,
 being persuaded to that course by considerations of justice and
 the advice of men skilled in the law. But that you may be more
 careful in the future nor become more prone to the like
 practices, and that your crimes may not remain unpunished, and
 that you may be an example to other sinners; having consulted
 with many eminent and learned lawyers and Masters or Doctors of
 the faculty of Theology, having carefully digested the whole
 matter, and having before our eyes only God and the truth of the
 Catholic Apostolic Faith, having set before us the Holy Gospel
 that our judgement may proceed as from God's countenance and our
 eyes see with equity, and sitting in tribunal as Judges, we
 condemn, or rather impose penance in the following manner upon
 you, N., standing here in person before us: namely, that you
 shall never hereafter presume to do, say, or teach such and such
 things. And let there be set down those things of which she has
 been convicted, and by reason of which she was strongly suspected
 of the aforesaid heresy, as well as certain others which, if she
 were to commit them, would make her guilty of a slight relapse
 into heresy; but this must be as the particular nature of the
 case demands and requires. As, for example, that she should never
 wittingly follow such practices, nor receive those whom she knows
 to have denied the faith, etc. This sentence was given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it must be noted that those who are suspected, but not taken
 in heresy, whether they be strongly or lightly suspected, must
 not be imprisoned or confined for life. For this is the
 punishment of those who have been heretics and afterwards
 repented. But they may, because of their deeds for which they
 have come under suspicion, be sent to prison for a time, and
 afterwards, as will be seen, released.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Neither are they to be branded with the sign of the Cross, for
 such is the sign of a penitent heretic; and they are not
 convicted heretics, but only suspected, therefore they are not to
 be marked in this way. But they can be ordered either to stand on
 certain solemn days within the doors of a church, or near the
 altar, while Holy Mass is being celebrated, bearing in their
 hands a lighted candle of a certain
 weight; or else to go on some pilgrimage, or something of the
 kind, according to the nature and requirements of the case.

<h2>Question XXV</h2>
<h3>The Sixth Kind of Sentence, in the Case of one who is Gravely Suspect</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE sixth method of bringing to a conclusion a process on behalf
 of the faith is used when the person accused of heresy, after a
 careful examination of the merits of the process in consultation
 with learned lawyers, is found to be gravely suspected of heresy.
 And this is when the accused is not convicted of heresy by her
 own confession or by the evidence of the facts or by the
 legitimate productions of witnesses, but there are indications,
 not only light or even strong, but very strong and grave, which
 render her gravely suspected of the said heresy, and by reason of
 which she must be judged as one gravely suspected of the said
 heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And for a clearer understanding of this, we shall give examples
 both of a case of simple heresy and of the heresy of witches. For
 the case would fall under this head in simple heresy if the
 accused were not lawfully found convicted by his own confession,
 etc. as above, but for something which he had said or done. As,
 for example, he may have been summoned in a case not concerning
 the faith, and have been sentenced to excommunication; and if he
 should continue obstinate in excommunication for a year or more,
 he would come under a light suspicion of heresy; for such
 behaviour is not without some suspicion of heresy. But if he
 should then be summoned on a charge concerning the faith, and
 should not appear but contumaciously refuse to appear, and
 therefore be excommunicated, then he would be strongly suspected
 of heresy; for then the light suspicion would become a strong
 one. And if he remained obstinate in that excommunication for a
 year, then he would be gravely suspected of heresy; for then the
 strong suspicion would become a grave one, against which no
 defence is admitted. And from that time such a person would be
 condemned as a heretic, as is shown by the Canon, c. <i>cum
 contumacia</i>, lib. 6.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 An example of a grave suspicion in the heresy of witches would be
 when the accused has said or done anything which is practised by
 witches when they wish to bewitch anyone. And it commonly happens
 that they are constrained to manifest themselves by threatening
 words, by deeds, by a look or a touch, and this is for three
 reasons. First that their sins may be aggravated and more
 manifest to the their Judges; secondly, that they may be the more
 easily seduce the simple; and thirdly, that God may be the more
 offended and they may be granted more power of injuring men.
 Therefore a witch must be gravely suspected when, after she has
 used such threatening words as “I will soon make you
 feel,” or the like, some injury has befallen the person so
 threatened or his cattle. For then she is not to be considered as
 lightly suspected, as was the case with those who are familiar
 with witches, or those who wish to provoke someone to inordinate
 love. See above where we deal with the three degrees of
 suspicion, light, strong, and grave.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Now we must consider what procedure is to be observed in such a
 case. For in the case of one gravely suspected of simple heresy,
 the following is the procedure. Although he may not in actual
 truth be a heretic, since there may not be any error in his
 understanding, or if there is, he may not cling obstinately to it
 in his will: nevertheless he is to be condemned as a heretic
 because of the said grave suspicion, against which no proof is
 admitted.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Such a heretic is condemned in this manner. If he refuses to
 return and abjure his heresy and give fitting satisfaction, he is
 delivered to the secular Court to be punished. But if he is
 willing and consents, he abjures his heresy and is imprisoned for
 life. And the same holds good in the case of one gravely
 suspected of the heresy of witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But although the same method in the main is to be observed in the
 case of one gravely suspected of the heresy of witches, there are
 some differences. It is to be noted that, if the witch maintains
 her denial, or claims that she uttered those words not with the
 implied intention but in a vehement and womanish passion; then
 the Judge has not sufficient warrant to sentence her to the
 flames, in spite of the grave suspicion. Therefore he must place
 her in prison, and cause inquiry to be made by proclamation
 whether she has been known to have done the like before. And if
 it is found that this is so, he must inquire whether she was then
 publicly defamed in respect of that heresy; and from this he can
 proceed further so that, before all else, she may be exposed to
 an interrogation under the question and torture. And then, if she
 shows signs of such heresy, or of the taciturnity of witches; as
 that she should be unable to shed tears, or remain insensible
 under torture and quickly recover her strength afterwards; then
 he may proceed with the various precautions which we have already
 explained where we dealt with such cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And in case all should fail, then let him take note that, if she
 has perpetrated the like before, she is not to be altogether
 released, but must be sent to the squalor of prison for a year,
 and be tortured, and be examined very often, especially on the
 more Holy Days. But if, in addition to this, she has been
 defamed, then the Judge may proceed in the manner already shown
 in the case of simple heresy, and condemn her to the fire,
 especially if there is a multitude of witnesses and she had often
 been detected in similar or other deeds of witchcraft. But if he
 wishes to be merciful, he may set her a canonical purgation, that
 she should find twenty or thirty sponsors, sentencing her in such
 a way that, if she should fail in her purgation, she shall be
 condemned to the fire as convicted. And the Judge can proceed in
 such a manner.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if she should purge herself, then the Judge must sentence her
 to an abjuration of all heresy, on pain of the punishment for
 backsliders, together with the perpetual penance, in the
 following manner. The preparations for the abjuration will be the
 same as were explained in the fourth and fifth methods of
 concluding a process on behalf of the faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Note that in all the following methods of pronouncing sentence,
 when the Judge wishes to proceed in a merciful manner he can act
 in the way we have already explained. But since secular Judges
 use their own various methods, proceeding with rigour but not
 always with equity, no fixed rule or method can be given for them
 as it can for an ecclesiastical Judge, who can receive the
 abjuration and impose a perpetual penance in the following
 manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, standing in person
 before you my venerable Lords the Bishop of such city and Judges,
 having touched with my hands the Holy Gospel placed before me,
 swear that I believe in my heart and profess with my lips the
 Holy Catholic and Apostolic Faith which the Holy Roman Church
 holds, professes, believes, preaches and teaches. And
 consequently I abjure all heresy, and renounce and revoke all who
 raise themselves against the Holy Roman and Apostolic Church, of
 whatever sect or error they be. Also I swear and promise that I
 shall never henceforward do, say, or cause to be done such and
 such (naming them) which I have done and said, and for which, in
 my guilt, you hold me gravely suspected of the said heresy. Also
 I swear and promise that I will perform every penance which you
 wish to impose upon me for the said crimes to the best of my
 strength, and that I will not omit any part of it, so help me God
 and the Holy Gospel. And if (which God forbid) I should hereafter
 act in contravention of this abjuration, I here and now bind and
 oblige myself to suffer the due punishments for backsliders,
 however sever they may be.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let the Notary take care to set it down that the said abjuration
 was made by one gravely suspected of heresy, so that if she
 should be proved to have relapsed, she should then be judged
 accordingly and delivered up to the secular Court.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 After this let the Bishop absolve her from the sentence of
 excommunication which she has incurred as one gravely suspected
 of heresy. For when a heretic returns to the faith and abjures
 his heresy, he is to be released from the sentence of
 excommunication which is passed on all heretics. Similarly, such
 a one as we are considering was condemned as a heretic, as we
 have said; but after she has abjured her heresy she is to be
 released from excommunication; and after this absolution she is
 to be sentenced in the following manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We N., Bishop of such city, and, if he is present, Judge in the
 territory of such Lord, seeing that you N., of such a place in
 such a Diocese, have been accused before us of such and such
 touching the faith (naming them), and that we have proceeded to
 inform ourselves concerning them as justice demanded by a careful
 examination of the merits of the process and of all that has been
 done and said in the present case, have found that you have
 committed such and such (naming them). Wherefore, and not without
 reason holding you gravely suspected of such heresy (naming it),
 we have caused you as one so suspected publicly to abjure all
 heresy in general, as the canonical sanctions bid us. And since
 according to those same canonical institutions all such are to be
 condemned as heretics, but you holding to wiser counsel and
 returning to the bosom of our Holy Mother the Church have
 abjured, as we have said, all vile heresy, therefore we absolve
 you from the sentence of excommunication by which you were
 deservedly bound as one hateful to the Church of God. And if with
 true heart and faith unfeigned you have returned to the unity of
 the Church, you shall be reckoned from henceforth among the
 penitent, and as from now are received back into the merciful
 bosom of the Holy Church. But since it would be most scandalous
 to pass over with connivent eyes and leave unpunished your
 offences against God and your injuries to men, for it is a graver
 matter to offend the Divine Majesty than a human monarch, and
 that your crimes may not be an incentive for other sinners, and
 that you may become more careful in the future and less prone to
 commit again the aforesaid crimes, and may suffer the less
 punishment in the next world: We the aforesaid Bishop and Judge,
 having availed ourselves of the wise and considered advice of
 learned men in this matter, sitting in tribunal as Judges
 judging, having before our eyes only God and the irrefragable
 truth of the Holy Faith, with the Holy Gospels placed before us
 that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and
 our eyes see with equity, sentence and condemn, or rather impose
 penance in the following manner upon you N., appearing in person
 before us on the day and at the hour which was before assigned to
 you. First, you shall put on over all the garments which you wear
 a grey-blue garment after the manner of a monk’s scapulary,
 made without a hood either before or behind, and having upon it
 crosses of yellow cloth three palms long and two palms wide, and
 you shall wear this garment over all others for such a length of
 time (setting a period of one or two years, more or less as the
 guilt of the person demands), And in the said garment and crosses
 you shall stand in the door of such a church at such a time for
 so long, or on the four major
 Feasts of the Glorious Virgin, or in such and such cities in
 the doors of such and such churches; and we sentence and condemn
 you for life, or for such a period, to such a prison. (Let this
 be set down as seems most to the honour of the faith, and
 according to the greater or less guilt and obstinacy of the
 accused.) And we expressly, and in the sure knowledge that it is
 so ordained by canonical institution, reserve to ourselves the
 right to mitigate the said penance, to increase it, change it, or
 remove it, in whole or in part, as often as seems good to us.
 This sentence was given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And when this has been read, it shall at once be duly put into
 execution, and she shall be clothed with the aforesaid garment
 with the crosses as has been said.

<h2>Question XXVI</h2>
<h3>The Method of passing Sentence upon one who is both Suspect and Defamed</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE seventh method of bringing to a conclusion a process on behalf of the
 faith is employed when the person accused of the sin of heresy, after a
 careful examination of the merits of the process in consultation with men
 learned in the law, is found to be both suspected and defamed of heresy. And
 this is when the accused is not legally convicted by his own confession or by
 the evidence of the facts or by the legitimate production of witnesses; but is
 found to be publicly defamed, and there are also other indications which
 render him lightly or strongly suspected of heresy: as that he has held much
 familiarity with heretics. And such a person must, because of his defamation,
 undergo a canonical purgation; and because of the suspicion against him he
 must abjure the heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The procedure in such a case will be as follows. Such a person, being publicly
 defamed for heresy, and being in addition to this suspected of heresy by
 reason of certain other indications, shall first publicly purge himself in the
 manner which we explained in the second method. Having performed this
 purgation, he shall immediately, as one against whom there are other
 indications of the suspected heresy, abjure that heresy in the following
 manner, having before him, as before, the Book of the Gospels:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 I., N., of such a place in such a Diocese, standing my trial in person before
 you my Lords, N., Bishop of such city and Judge in the territory of such
 Prince, having touched with my hands the Holy Gospels placed before me, swear
 that I believe in my heart and profess with my lips that Holy Apostolic Faith
 which the Roman Church believes, professes, preaches and observes. And
 consequently I abjure, detest, renounce and revoke every heresy which rears
 itself up against the Holy and Apostolic Church, of whatever sect or error it
 be, etc., as above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also I swear and promise that I will never hereafter do or say or cause to be
 done such and such (naming them), for which I am justly defamed as having
 committed them, and of which you hold be suspected. Also I swear and promise
 that I will perform to the best of my strength every penance which you impose
 on me, nor will I omit any part of it, so help me God and this Holy Gospel.
 And if hereafter I should act in any way contrary to this oath and abjuration
 (which God forbid), I here and now freely submit, oblige, and bind myself to
 the legal punishment for such, to the limit of sufferance, when it shall have
 been proved that I have committed such things.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But it must be noted that when the indications are so strong as to render the
 accused, either with or without the aforesaid defamation, strongly suspected
 of heresy, then he shall, as above, abjure all heresy in general. And if he
 relapsed into any heresy, he shall suffer the due punishment of a backslider.
 But if the indications are so small and slight as, even taken together with
 the said defamation, not to render him strongly, but only lightly, suspected
 of heresy, then it is enough if he makes not a general abjuration, but
 specifically abjures that heresy of which he is suspected; so that, if he were
 to relapse into another form of heresy, he would not be liable to the penalty
 for backsliders. And even if he were to relapse into the same heresy which he
 had abjured, he would still not be liable to the said penalty, although he
 would be more severely punished than would have been the case if he had not
 abjured.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there is a doubt whether he would be liable to the penalty for backsliders
 if, after his canonical purgation, he should relapse into the same heresy of
 which he was canonically purged. And it would seem that this would be so, from
 the Canon Law, c. <i>excommunicamus</i> and c. <i>ad abolendam</i>. Therefore
 the Notary must take great care to set it down whether such a person has made
 his abjuration as one under a light or a strong suspicion of heresy; for, as
 we have often said, there is a great difference between these. And when this
 has been done, sentence or penance shall be pronounced in the following
 manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We., N., Bishop of such city or Judge in the territories of such Prince,
 having diligently in mind that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese,
 have been accused before us of such heresy (naming it); and wishing to inquire
 judicially whether you have fallen into the said heresy, by examining
 witnesses, by summoning and questioning you upon oath, and by all convenient
 means in our power, we have acted and proceeded as it behoved.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Having digested, observed and diligently inspected all the facts, and having
 discussed the merits of the process of this case, examining al and singular
 which has been done and said, and having consulted with and obtained the
 mature opinion of many learned Theologians and lawyers, we find that you have
 been in such place or places publicly defamed by good and sober men for the
 said heresy; wherefore, as we are bidden by the canonical institutions, we
 have imposed upon you a canonical purgation by which you and your sponsors
 have here publicly purged yourself before us. We find also that you have
 committed such and such (naming them), by reason of which we have just cause t
 hold you strongly or lightly (let it be said whether it is one or the other)
 suspected of the said heresy; and therefore we have caused you to abjure
 heresy as one under such suspicion (here, if he has abjured as one under
 strong suspicion, let them say “all heresy”; and if as one under
 light suspicion, “the said heresy”).<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But because we cannot and must not in any way tolerate that which you have
 done, but are in justice compelled to abominate it, that you may become more
 careful in the future, and that your crimes may not remain unpunished, and
 that others may not be encouraged to fall into the like sins, and that the
 injuries to the Creator may not easily be passed over: Therefore against you,
 N., having so purged yourself and abjured, standing personally in our presence
 in this place at the time which was assigned to you, We, the aforesaid Bishop
 or Judge, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy
 Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and our
 eyes see with equity, pronounce sentence or penance in the following manner,
 namely, that you must, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And let them pronounce sentence as shall seem most to the honour of the faith
 and the extermination of the sin of heresy: as that on certain Sundays and
 Festivals he must stand at the door of such a church, holding a candle of such
 a weight, during the solemnization of Holy Mass, with head uncovered and bare
 feet, and offer the said candle at the altar; and that he must fast on
 Fridays, and that for a certain period he must not dare to depart from that
 place, but present himself before the Bishop or Judge on certain days of the
 week; and any similar penance which seemed to be demanded by the particular
 nature of his guilt; for it is impossible to give a hard-and-fast rule. This
 sentence was given, etc. And let it be put into execution after it has been
 pronounced; and it can be cancelled, mitigated or changed as may be required
 by the condition of the penitent and for his correction and humiliation; for
 the Bishop has this power by law.

<h2>Question XVII</h2>
<h3>The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy, but is still not Penitent</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The eighth method of terminating a process on behalf of the faith
 is used when the person accused of heresy, after a careful
 examination of the merits of the process in consultation with
 learned lawyers, is found to have confessed his heresy, but to be
 penitent, and not truly to have relapsed into heresy. And this is
 when the accused has himself confessed in a Court of law under
 oath before the Bishop and Inquisitor that he has for so long
 lived and persisted in that heresy of which he is accused, or in
 any other, and has believed in and adhered to it; but that
 afterwards, being persuaded by the Bishop and others, he wishes
 to be converted and to return to the bosom of the Church, and to
 abjure that and every heresy, and to make such satisfaction as
 they require of him; and it is found that he has made no previous
 abjuration of any other heresy, but is now willing and prepared
 to abjure.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In such a case the procedure will be as follows. Although such a
 person has for many years persisted in the said heresy and even
 in others, and has believed and practised them and led many
 others into error; yet if at last he has consented to abjure
 those heresies and to make such satisfaction as the Bishop and
 the ecclesiastical Judge shall decree, he is not to be delivered
 up to the secular Court to suffer the extreme penalty; nor, if he
 is a cleric, is he to be degraded. But he is to admitted to
 mercy, according to the Canon <i>ad abolendam</i>. And after he
 has abjured his former heresy he is to be confined in prison for
 life (see the Canon <i>excommunicamus</i>, where it provides for
 the absolution of such). But great care must be taken that he has
 no simulated a false penitence in order to be received back into
 the Church. Also the secular Court is not at all bound by such a
 sentence as the above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 He shall make his abjuration in the manner already set out, with
 this difference. He shall with his own mouth confess his crimes
 before the congregation in church on a Feast Day, in the
 following manner. The clerk shall ask him, have you for so many
 years persisted in the heresy of witches? And he shall answer,
 Yes. And then, Have you done this and this to which you have
 confessed? And he shall answer, Yes. And so on. And finally he
 shall make his abjuration kneeling on his knees. And since,
 having been convicted of heresy, he has been excommunicated,
 after he has by abjuration returned to the bosom of the Church,
 he is to be granted the grace of absolution, according to the
 manner used by the Bishops with Apostolic authority of absolving
 from the major excommunication. And sentence shall at once be
 pronounced in the following manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, the Bishop of such city, or the Judge in the territories of
 such Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a place in such a
 Diocese, have been by public report and the information of
 credible persons accused before us of the sin of heresy; and
 since you had for many years been infected with that heresy to
 the great damage of your soul; and because this accusation
 against you has keenly wounded our hearts: we whose duty it is by
 reason of the office which we have received to plant the Holy
 Catholic Faith in the hearts of men and to keep away all heresy
 from their minds, wishing to be more certainly informed whether
 there was any truth in the report which had come to our ears, in
 order that, if it were true, we might provide a healthy and
 fitting remedy, proceeded in the best way which was open to us to
 question and examine witness and to interrogate you on oath
 concerning that of which you were accused, doing all and singular
 which was required of us by justice and the canonical
 sanctions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And since we wished to bring your case to a suitable conclusion,
 and to have a clear understanding of your past state of mind,
 whether you were walking in the darkness or in the light, and
 whether or not you had fallen into the sin of heresy; having
 conducted the whole process, we summoned together in council
 before us learned men of the Theological faculty and men skilled
 in both the Canon and the Civil Law, knowing that, according to
 canonical institution, the judgement is sound which is confirmed
 by the opinion of many; and having on all details consulted the
 opinion of the said learned men, and having diligently and
 carefully examined all the circumstances of the process; we find
 that you are, by your own confession made on oath before us in
 the Court, convicted of many of the sins of witches. (Let them be
 expressed in detail.)<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since the Lord in His infinite mercy permits men at times to
 fall into heresies and errors, not only that learned Catholics
 may be exercised in sacred arguments, but that they who have
 fallen from the faith may become more humble thereafter and
 perform works of penitence: having carefully discussed the
 circumstances of this same process, we find that you, at our
 frequent instance and following the advice of us and other honest
 men, have with a healthy mind returned to the unity and bosom of
 the Holy Mother Church, detesting the said errors and heresies,
 and acknowledging the irrefragable truth of the Holy Catholic
 Faith, laying it t your inmost heart: wherefore, following in His
 footsteps Who wishes that no one should perish, we have admitted
 you to this adjuration and public abjuration of the said an all
 other heresies. And having done this, we absolve you from the
 sentence of major excommunication by which you were bound for
 your fall into heresy, and reconciling you to the Holy Mother
 Church we restore you to the sacraments of the Church; provided
 that with a true heart, and not with simulated faith, you return
 to the unity of the Church, as we believe and hope that you have
 done.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But because it would be a very scandalous thing to avenge the
 injuries done to temporal Lords and to tolerate the offences
 committed against God the Creator of all the Heavens, since it is
 a far greater sin to offend against the Eternal than against a
 temporal Majesty, and that God Who pities sinners may have mercy
 upon you, that you may be an example for others, and that your
 sins may not remain unpunished, and that you may become more
 careful in the future, and not more prone but less apt to commit
 the said and any other crimes: We the said Bishop and Judge, or
 Judges, on behalf of the faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges
 judging, etc., as above . . . that you put on a grey-blue
 garment, etc. Also we sentence and condemn you to perpetual
 imprisonment, there to be punished with the bread of affliction
 and the water of distress;
 reserving to ourselves the right to mitigate, aggravate, change,
 or remit wholly or in part the said sentence if, when, and as
 often as it shall seem good to us to do so. This sentence was
 given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 After this the Judge shall proceed point by point, pronouncing
 sentence in the following or some similar manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 My son, your sentence or penance consists in this, that you bear
 this cross during the whole period of your life, that you stand
 so bearing it on the altar steps or in the door of such churches,
 and that you be imprisoned for life on bread and water. But, my
 son, lest this may seem too hard for you, I assure you that if
 you patiently bear your punishment you will find mercy with us;
 therefore doubt not nor despair, but hope strongly.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 After this, let the sentence be duly executed, and let him put on
 the said garment and be placed on high upon the altar steps in
 full view of the people as they go out, surrounded by the
 officers of the secular Court. And at the dinner hour let him be
 led by the officers to prison, and the rest of the sentence be
 carried out and duly performed. And after he is led out through
 the door of the church, let the ecclesiastical Judge have no more
 to do with the matter; and if the secular Court be satisfied, it
 is well, but if not, let it do its pleasure.

<h2>Question XVIII</h2>
<h3>The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy but is Relapsed, Albeir now Penitent</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE ninth method of arriving at a conclusive sentence in a
 process on behalf of the faith is used when the person accused of
 heresy, after a careful investigation of the circumstances of the
 process in consultation with men of good judgement, is found to
 have confessed her heresy and to be penitent, but that she has
 truly relapsed. And this is when the accused herself confesses in
 Court before the Bishop or Judges that she has at another time
 abjured all heresy, and this is legally proved, and that she has
 afterwards fallen into such a heresy or error: or that she has
 abjured some particular heresy, such as that of witches, and has
 afterwards returned to it; but that following better advice she
 is penitent, and believes the Catholic faith, and returns to the
 unity of the Church. Such a one is not, if she humbly ask for
 them, to be denied the sacraments of Penance and the Eucharist;
 but however much she may repent, she is nevertheless to be
 delivered up as a backslider to the secular Court to suffer the
 extreme penalty. But it must be understood that this refers to
 one who had made her abjuration as one manifestly taken in
 heresy, or as one strongly suspected of heresy, and not to one
 who has so done as being under only a light suspicion.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The following procedure must be observed in this case. When,
 after mature and careful and, if necessary, repeated
 investigation by learned men, it has been concluded that the said
 prisoner has actually and prepense relapsed into heresy, the
 Bishop or Judge shall send to the said prisoner in the place of
 detention two or three honest men, especially religious or
 clerics, who are zealous for the faith, of whom the prisoner has
 no suspicion, but rather places confidence in them; and they
 shall go in to her at a suitable time and speak to her sweetly of
 the contempt of this world and the miseries of this life, and of
 the joys and glory of Paradise. And leading up from this, they
 shall indicate to her on the part of the Bishop or Judge that she
 cannot escape temporal death, and that she should therefore take
 care for the safety of her soul, and prepare herself to confess
 her sins and receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist. And they
 shall visit her often, persuading her to penitence and patience,
 strengthening her as much as they can in the Catholic truth, and
 they shall diligently cause her to confess, so that she may
 receive the Sacrament of the Eucharist at her humble petition.
 For these Sacraments are not to be denied to such offenders.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And when she has received these Sacraments, and been well
 disposed by these men to salvation; after two or three days
 during which they have strengthened her in the Catholic faith and
 induced her to repentance, the Bishop or Judge of that place
 shall notify the bailiff of the place or the authorities of the
 secular Court, that on such a day at such an hour (not a Feast
 Day) he should be with his attendants in such a square or place
 (but it must be outside a church) to receive from their Court a
 certain backslider whom the Bishop and Judge will hand over to
 him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And on the morning of the day fixed, or on the day before, it
 shall be publicly proclaimed throughout the city of place in
 those towns and villages where such proclamations are customary,
 that on such a day at such an hour in such a place there will be
 a sermon preached in defence of the Faith, and that the Bishop
 and other Judges will condemn a certain person who has relapsed
 into the sin of heresy, delivering her up to secular justice.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But here it must be considered that, if he who has so relapsed
 should have been ordained in any Holy Orders, or should be a
 priest or a religious of any Order, before he is handed over he
 is to be degraded and stripped of the privileges of his
 ecclesiastic order. And so, when he has been degraded from all
 ecclesiastical office, let him be handed over to secular justice
 to receive his due punishment.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 When, therefore, such a one is to be degraded from his orders and
 handed over to the secular Court, let the Bishop summon together
 all the prelates and religious men of his Diocese. For in this
 case, though not in others, only the Bishop together with the
 other prelates and religious and learned men of his diocese can
 degrade one who has received Holy Orders when he is to be
 delivered to the secular Court, or is to be imprisoned for life
 for the sin of heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On the day appointed for the degrading of the backslider and the
 handing of him over to the secular Court, if he be a cleric, or,
 if he be a layman, for leaving him to hear his definitive
 sentence, the people shall gather together in some square or open
 place outside the church, and the Inquisitor shall preach a
 sermon, and the prisoner shall be set on a high place in the
 presence of the secular authorities. And if the prisoner be a
 cleric who is to be degraded, the Bishop shall don his Pontifical
 robes, together with the other prelates of his Diocese in their
 vestments and copes, and the prisoner shall be clothed and robed
 as if he were to minister his office; and the Bishop shall
 degrade him from his order, beginning from the higher and
 proceeding to the lowest. And just as in conferring Holy Orders
 the Bishop uses the words ordained by the Church, so in degrading
 him he shall take off his chasuble and stole, and so with the
 other vestments, using words of a directly opposite meaning.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 When this degradation has been accomplished, the proceedings must
 continue in the legal and accustomed manner, and the Notary or
 religious or clerk shall be bidden to read the sentence, which
 shall be after the following manner, whether the prisoner be a
 layman or a degraded cleric:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, N., by the mercy of the God Bishop of such city, and Judge in
 the territories of such Prince, seeing that we are legitimately
 informed that you, N., of such a place in such a Diocese, have
 been before us (or before such Bishop and Judges) accused of such
 heresy or heresies (naming them), of which you were lawfully
 convicted by your own confession and by witnesses, and that you
 had obstinately persisted in them for so long, but afterwards,
 listening to better advice, publicly in such a place abjured,
 renounced and revoked those heresies in the form provided by the
 Church, on which account the said Bishop and Inquisitor,
 believing that you had truly returned to the bosom of the Holy
 Church of God, did absolve you from the sentence of
 excommunication by which you were bound, enjoining upon you a
 salutary penance if with true heart and faith unfeigned you had
 returned to the unity of the Holy Church; but whereas after all
 the aforesaid and the lapse of so many years you are again
 accused before us and have again fallen into such heresies which
 you had abjured (naming them), and though it was sore grief to us
 to hear such things of you, yet we were by justice compelled to
 investigate the matter, to examine the witnesses, and to summon
 and question you on oath, proceeding in each and every way as we
 are bidden by the canonical institutions.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And since we wished to conclude this case without any doubt, we
 convened in solemn council learned men of the Theological faculty
 and men skilled in the Canon and the Civil Law, and in
 consultation with them maturely and carefully examined all and
 singular which had been done, said and seen in the process and
 diligently discussed each circumstance, weighing all equally in
 the balance as it behoved us; and we find both by the legitimate
 evidence of witnesses and by your own confession received in
 Court that you have fallen into the heresies which you had
 abjured. For we find that you have said or done such and such
 (let all be named), on account of which, with the concurrence of
 the said learned men, we have judged and now judge that you are a
 backslider, according tot he canonical institutions, to which we
 refer in grief and grieve to refer.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since it has come to the knowledge of Us and of many honest
 Catholic men that, by the inspiration of Divine grade, you have
 once more returned to the bosom of the Church and to the truth of
 the faith detesting the aforesaid errors and heresies and with
 true orthodoxy unfeigned believing and protesting the Catholic
 faith, we have admitted you to receive the Church's Sacraments of
 Penance and the Holy Eucharist at your humble request. But since
 the Church of God has no more which it can do in respect of you,
 seeing that it has acted so mercifully towards you in the manner
 we have said, and you have abused that mercy by falling back into
 the heresies which you had abjured: therefore We the said Bishop
 and Judges, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before
 us the Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the
 countenance of God and our eyes see with equity, and having
 before our eyes only God and the irrefragable truth of the Holy
 Faith and the extirpation of the plague of heresy; against you,
 N., in this place on the day and at the hour before assigned to
 you for the hearing of your definitive sentence, we pronounce in
 sentence that you have truly fallen back into the sin of heresy,
 although you are penitent; and as one truly so relapsed we cast
 you forth from this our ecclesiastical Court, and leave you to be
 delivered to the secular arm. But we earnestly pray that the said
 secular Court may temper its justice with mercy, and that there
 be no bloodshed or danger of death.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And here the Bishop and his assessors shall withdraw, and the
 secular Court shall perform its office.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is to be noted that, although the Bishop and Inquisitor ought
 to use their utmost diligence, both by their own efforts and
 those of others, to induce the prisoner to repent and return to
 the Catholic faith; yet, after he has repented and it has been
 decided in council that, though he is penitent, he is
 nevertheless truly a backslider and as such to be handed over in
 person to the secular Court, they ought not to inform him of such
 sentence and punishment. therefore from that time, neither before
 nor after the sentence should they present themselves before him,
 that he be not moved in his spirit against them, a thing which is
 very carefully to be avoided in death of this sort. But, as we
 have said, let them send to him some honest men, especially those
 in religious orders, or clerics, in whom he has confidence; and
 let them inform him of the sentence to come and of his death, and
 strengthen him in the faith, exhorting him to have patience; and
 let them visit him after the sentence, and console him and pray
 with him, and not leave him until he has rendered his spirit to
 his Creator.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let them, therefore, beware and be on their guard not to do or
 say anything which may enable the prisoner to anticipate his
 death, or place themselves in an irregular position. And, as they
 have burdened themselves with the care of his soul, let them then
 share also in his punishment and guilt.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It must also be remarked that such a sentence which delivers up a
 person to the secular Court ought not to be pronounced on a
 Festival or Solemn Day, nor in a church, but outside in some open
 space. For it is a sentence which leads to death; and it is more
 decent that it should be delivered on an ordinary day and outside
 the church; for a Feast Day and the church are dedicated to
 God.

<h2>Question XXIX</h2>
<h3>The Method of passing Sentence upon one who hath Confessed to Heresy but is Impenitent, although not Relapsed</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE tenth method of completing a process on behalf of the Faith
 by a final sentence is used when the person accused of heresy,
 after a careful examination of the circumstances of the process
 in consultation with skilled lawyers, is found to have confessed
 his heresy and to be impenitent, though he has not relapsed into
 the heresy. Such a case is very rarely found, but yet it has come
 within the experience of us Inquisitors. In such a case,
 therefore, the Bishop and Judge must not be in haste to sentence
 the prisoner, but must keep him well guarded and fettered, and
 induce him to be converted, even to the extent of several months,
 showing him that, by remaining impenitent, he will be damned in
 body and soul.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if neither by comforts nor hardships, nor by threatening nor
 persuasion, can he be brought to renounce his errors, and the
 appointed period of grace has expired, let the Bishop and Judges
 prepare to deliver or abandon him to the secular Court; and they
 shall give notice to the herald or bailiff or secular authorities
 that on such a day, not a Feast, and at such an hour they should
 be in such a place with their attendants outside a church, and
 that they will deliver to them a certain impenitent heretic. None
 the less they shall themselves make public proclamation in the
 customary places that on such a day at such a time in the
 aforesaid place a sermon will be preached in defence of the
 faith, and that they will hand over a certain heretic to secular
 justice; and that all should come and be present, being granted
 the customary Indulgences.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 After this, the prisoner shall be delivered to the secular Court
 in the following manner. But let him first be often admonished to
 renounce his heresy and repent; but if he altogether refuses, let
 the sentence be pronounced.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such a city, or Judge in
 the territories of such Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a
 place in such a Diocese, have been accused before us by public
 report and the information of credible persons (naming them) of
 heresy, and that you have for many years persisted in those
 heresies to the great hurt of your immortal soul; and since we,
 whose duty it is to exterminate the plague of heresy, wishing to
 be more certainly informed of this matter and to see whether you
 walked in darkness or the light, have diligently inquired into
 the said accusation, summoning and duly examining you, we find
 that you are indeed infected with the said heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since it is the chief desire of our hearts to plant the Holy
 Catholic Faith in the hearts of our people, and to eradicate the
 pest of heresy, we have used diverse and various suitable
 methods, both by ourselves and by others, to persuade you to
 renounce your said errors and heresies in which you had stood,
 were standing, and even now defiantly and obstinately stand with
 stubborn heart. But since the Enemy of the human race is present
 in your heart, wrapping you up and entangling you in the said
 errors, and you have refused and yet refuse to abjure the said
 heresies, choosing rather the death of your soul in hell and of
 your body in this world than to renounce the said heresies and
 return to the bosom of the Church and cleanse your soul, and
 since you are determined to remain in your sin:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore inasmuch as you are bound by the chain of
 excommunication from the Holy Church, and are justly cut off from
 the number of the Lord's flock, and are deprived of the benefits
 of the Church, the Church can do no more for you, having done all
 that was possible. We the said Bishop and Judges on behalf of the
 Faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, and having before
 us the Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the
 countenance of god and our eyes see with equity, and having
 before our eyes only God and the truth of the Holy Faith and the
 extirpation of the plague of heresy, on this day and at this hour
 and place assigned to you for the hearing of your final sentence,
 we give it as our judgement and sentence that you are indeed an
 impenitent heretic, and as truly such to be delivered and
 abandoned to the secular Court: wherefore by this sentence we
 cast you away as an impenitent heretic from our ecclesiastical
 Court, and deliver or abandon you to the power of the secular
 Court: praying the said Court to moderate or temper its sentence
 of death against you. This sentence was given,
 etc.

<h2>Question XXX</h2>
<h3>Of One who has Confessed to Heresy, is Relapsed, and is also Impenitent</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE eleventh method of concluding and terminating a process on
 behalf of the Faith is used when the person accused of heresy,
 after a diligent discussion of the circumstances of the process
 in consultation with learned men, is found to have confessed her
 heresy, and to be impenitent, and to have relapsed into it. And
 this is when the accused confesses with her own mouth in Court
 that she believes and has practiced such and such. The procedure
 in this case is the same as that above; and because she is
 manifestly a heretic, sentence shall be pronounced in the
 following manner in the presence of the Bishop and Judges:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, or Judge in the
 territories of such Prince, seeing that you N., of such a place
 in such a Diocese, were formerly accused before us (or before
 such and such, our predecessors) of the crime of heresy (naming
 them), and that you were legally convicted of that crime by your
 own confession and the testimony of worthy men, and that you
 obstinately persisted in it for so many years; but that
 afterwards, having listened to better advice, you publicly
 abjured those heresies in such a place and in the form required
 by the Church, on which account the aforesaid Bishop and Judge,
 believing that you had truly renounced the said errors and had
 returned with Catholic faith to the bosom of the Church, granted
 you the benefit of absolution, releasing you from the sentence of
 excommunication by which you were formerly bound, and, setting
 you a salutary penance if with true heart and faith unfeigned you
 remained converted to the unity of the Holy Church, received you
 back in mercy. For the Holy Church of God is not closed to such
 as return to her bosom.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But after all the aforesaid you have to our great grief been
 accused before us of having again fallen into those damnable
 heresies which you formerly abjured in public; yea, you have done
 so and so (naming them) in contravention of the said abjuration
 and to the damage of your soul; and although we are sore wounded
 and cut to the heart to have heard such things of you, yet we
 were in justice compelled to inquire into the matter, to examine
 the witnesses, and to summon and question you on oath as it
 behoved us, and in every particular to proceed as we are bidden
 by the canonical institutions. And as we wished to conclude this
 case beyond any doubt, we summoned a solemn council of men
 learned in the Theological faculty and of those skilled in the
 Canon and Civil Laws.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And having obtained the mature and considered judgement of the
 said learned men upon every single particular which had been
 brought to notice and done in this case, after repeated
 examination of the whole process and careful and diligent
 discussion of every circumstance, as law and justice demanded, we
 find that you are legally convicted both by the evidence of
 credible witnesses and by your own repeated confession, that you
 have fallen, and fallen again, into the heresies which you
 abjured. For we find that you have said or done such and such
 (naming them), wherefore we have reason, in the opinion of the
 said learned men, and compelled thereto by your own excesses, to
 judge you as a backslider according to the canonical decrees. And
 that we say this with grief, and grieve to say it, He knows from
 Whom nothing is hid and Who seeth into the secrets of all hearts.
 And with all our hearts we desired and still desire to lead you
 back to the unity of the Holy Church and to drive out from your
 heart the said foul heresy, that so you may save your soul and
 preserve your body and soul from the destruction in hell, and we
 have exerted our utmost endeavor by various fitting methods to
 convert to salvation; but you have been given up to your sin and
 led away and seduced by an evil spirit, and have chosen to be
 tortured with fearful and eternal torment in hell, and that your
 temporal body should here be consumed in the flames, rather than
 to give ear to better counsels and renounce your damnable and
 pestilent errors, and to return to the merciful bosom of our Holy
 Mother Church.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore since the Church of God can do nothing more for you,
 having done all that was possible to convert you: We the Bishop
 and Judges named in this cause on behalf of the faith, sitting in
 tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy Gospels
 that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of God and
 our eyes see with equity, and having before our eyes only God and
 the honour of the Holy Catholic Faith, on this day at this hour
 and place before assigned to you for the hearing of your final
 sentence, we pronounce judgement upon you N., here present before
 us, and condemn and sentence you as a truly impenitent and
 relapsed heretic, and as such to be delivered or abandoned to
 secular justice; and by this our definitive sentence we cast you
 out as a truly impenitent and relapsed heretic from our
 ecclesiastical Court, and deliver and abandon you to the power of
 the secular Court; praying that the said secular Court will
 temper or moderate its sentence of death against you. This
 sentence was give, etc.

<h2>Question XXXI</h2>
<h3>Of One Taken and Convicted, but Denying Everything</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE twelfth method of finishing and concluding a process on
 behalf of the faith is used when the person accused of heresy,
 after a diligent examination of the merits of the process in
 consultation with skilled lawyers, is found to be convicted of
 heresy by the evidence of the facts or by the legitimate
 production of witnesses, but not by his own confession. That is
 to say, he may be convicted by the evidence of the facts, in that
 he has publicly practiced heresy; or by the evidence of witnesses
 against whom he can take no legitimate exception; yet, though so
 taken and convicted, he firmly and constantly denies the charge.
 See Henry of Segusio <i>On Heresy</i>, question 34.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The procedure in such a case is as follows. The accused must be
 kept in strong durance fettered and chained, and must often be
 visited by the officers, both in a body and severally, who will
 use their own best endeavours and those of others to induce him
 to discover the truth; telling him that if he refuses and
 persists in his denial, he will in the end be abandoned to the
 secular law, and will not be able to escape temporal death.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he continues for a long time in his denials, the Bishop
 and his officers, now in a body and now severally, now personally
 and now with the assistance of other honest and upright men,
 shall summon before them now one witness, now another, and warm
 him to attend strictly to what he has deposed, and to be sure
 whether or not he has told the truth; that he should beware lest
 in damning another temporally he damn himself eternally; that if
 he be afraid, let him at least tell them the truth in secret,
 that the accused should not die unjustly. And let them be careful
 to talk to him in such a way that they may see clearly whether or
 not his depositions have been true.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if the witnesses, after this warning, adhere to their
 statements, and the accused maintains his denials, let not the
 Bishop and his officers on that account be in any haste to
 pronounce a definitive sentence and hand the prisoners over to
 secular law; but let them detain him still longer, now persuading
 him to confess, now yet again urging the witnesses (but one at a
 time) to examine their consciences as well. And let the Bishop
 and his officers pay particular attention to that witness who
 seems to be of the best conscience and the most disposed to good,
 and let them more insistently charge him on his conscience to
 speak the truth whether or not the matter was as he had deposed.
 And if they see any witness vacillate, or there are any other
 indications that he has given false evidence, let them attest him
 according to the counsel of learned men, and proceed as justice
 shall require.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For it is very often found that after a person so convicted by
 credible witnesses has long persisted in his denials, he has at
 length relented, especially on being truly informed that he will
 not be delivered to the secular Court, but be admitted to mercy
 if he confesses his sin, and he has then freely confessed the
 truth which he had so long denied. And it is often found that the
 witnesses, actuated by malice and overcome by enmity, have
 conspired together to accuse an innocent person of the sin of
 heresy; but afterwards, at the frequent entreaty of the Bishop
 and his officers, their consciences have been stricken with
 remorse and, by Divine inspiration, they have revoked their
 evidence and confessed that they have out of malice put that
 crime upon the accused. Therefore the prisoner in such a case is
 not to be sentenced hastily, but must be kept for a year or more
 before he is delivered up to the secular Court.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 When a sufficient time has elapsed, and after all possible care
 has been taken, if the accused who has been thus legally
 convicted has acknowledged his guilt and confessed in legal from
 that he hath been for the period stated ensnared in the crime of
 heresy, and has consented to abjure that and every heresy, and to
 perform such satisfaction as shall seem proper to the Bishop and
 Inquisitor for one convicted of heresy both by his own confession
 and the legitimate production of witnesses; then let him as a
 penitent heretic publicly abjure all heresy, in the manner which
 we have set down in the eighth method of concluding a process on
 behalf of the faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he has confessed that he hath fallen into such heresy, but
 nevertheless obstinately adheres to it, he must be delivered to
 the secular Court as an impenitent, after the manner of the tenth
 method which we have explained above.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if the accused has remained firm and unmoved in his denial of
 the charges against him, but the witnesses have withdrawn their
 charges, revoking their evidence and acknowledging their guilt,
 confessing that they had put so great a crime upon an innocent
 man from motives of rancour and hatred, or had been suborned or
 bribed thereto; then the accused shall be freely discharged, but
 they shall be punished as false witnesses, accusers or informers.
 This made clear by Paul of Burgos in his comment on the Canon c.
 <i>multorum</i>. And sentence or penance shall be pronounced
 against them as shall seem proper to the Bishop and Judges; but
 in any case such false witnesses must be condemned to perpetual
 imprisonment on a diet of bread and water, and to do penance for
 all the days of their life, being made to stand upon the steps
 before the church door, etc. However, the Bishops have power to
 mitigate or even to increase the sentence after a year or some
 other period, in the usual manner.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if the accused, after a year or other longer period which has
 been deemed sufficient, continues to maintain his denials, and
 the legitimate witnesses abide by their evidence, the Bishop and
 Judges shall prepare to abandon him to the secular Court; sending
 to him certain honest men zealous for the faith, especially
 religious, to tell him that he cannot escape temporal death while
 he thus persists in his denial, but will be delivered up as an
 impenitent heretic to the power of the secular Court. And the
 Bishop and his officers shall give notice to the Bailiff or
 authority of the secular Court that on such a day at such an hour
 and in such a place (not inside a church) he should come with his
 attendants to receive an impenitent heretic whom they will
 deliver to him. And let him make public proclamation in the usual
 places that all should be present on such a day at such an hour
 and place to hear a sermon preached on behalf of the faith, and
 that the Bishop and his officer will hand over a certain
 obstinate heretic to the secular Court.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On the appointed day for the pronouncement of sentence the Bishop
 and his officer shall be in the place aforesaid, and the prisoner
 shall be placed on high before the assembled clergy and people so
 that he may be seen by all, and the secular authorities shall be
 present before the prisoner. Then sentence shall be pronounced in
 the following manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, or Judge in the
 territories of such Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a place
 in such a Diocese, have been accused before us of such heresy
 (naming it); and wishing to be more certainly informed whether
 the charges made against you were true, and whether you walked in
 darkness or in the light; we proceeded to inform ourselves by
 diligently examining the witnesses, by often summoning and
 questioning you on oath, and admitting an Advocate to plead in
 your defence, and by proceeding in every way as we were bound by
 the canonical decrees.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And wishing to conclude your trial in a manner beyond all doubt,
 we convened in solemn council men learned in the Theological
 faculty and in the Canon and Civil Laws. And having diligently
 examined and discussed each circumstance of the process and
 maturely and carefully considered with the said learned men
 everything which has been said and done in this present case, we
 find that you, N., have been legally convicted of having been
 infected with the sin of heresy for so long a time, and that you
 have said an done such and such (naming them) on account of which
 it manifestly appears that you are legitimately convicted of the
 said heresy.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since we desired, and still desire, that you should confess
 the truth and renounce the said heresy, and be led back to the
 bosom of Holy Church and to the unity of the Holy Faith, that so
 you should save your soul and escape the destruction of both your
 body and soul in hell; we have by our own efforts and those of
 others, and by delaying your sentence for a long time, tried to
 induce you to repent; but you being obstinately given over to
 wickedness have scorned to agree to our wholesome advice, and
 have persisted and do persist with stubborn and defiant mind in
 your contumacious and dogged denials; and this we say with grief,
 and grieve and mourn in saying it. But since the Church of God
 has waited so long for you to repent and acknowledge your guilt,
 and you have refused and still refuse, her grace and mercy can go
 no farther.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore that you may be an example to others and that they may
 be kept from all such heresies, and that such crimes may not
 remain unpunished: We the Bishop and Judges named on behalf of
 the faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, and having
 before us the Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from
 the countenance of God and our eyes see with equity, and having
 before our eyes only God and the glory and honour of the Holy
 Faith, we judge, declare and pronounce sentence that you standing
 here in our presence on this day at the hour and place appointed
 for the hearing of your final sentence, are an impenitent
 heretic, and as such to be delivered or abandoned to secular
 justice; and as an obstinate and impenitent heretic we have by
 this sentence cast you off from the ecclesiastical Court and
 deliver and abandon you to secular justice and the power of the
 secular Court. And we pray that the said secular Court may
 moderate its sentence of death upon you. this sentence was given,
 etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The Bishop and Judges may, moreover, arrange that just men
 zealous for the faith, known to and in the confidence of the
 secular Court, shall have access to the prisoner while the
 secular Court is performing its office, in order to console him
 and even yet induce him to confess the truth, acknowledge his
 guilt, and renounce his errors.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if it should happen that after the sentence, and when the
 prisoner is already at the place where he is to be burned, he
 should say that he wishes to confess the truth and acknowledge
 his guilt, and does so; and if he should be willing to abjure
 that and every heresy; although it may be presumed that he does
 this rather from fear of death than for love of the truth, yet I
 should be of the opinion that he may in mercy be received as a
 penitent heretic and be imprisoned for life. See the gloss on the
 chapters <i>ad abolendam</i> and <i>excommunicamus</i>.
 Nevertheless, according to the rigour of the law, the Judges
 ought not to place much faith in a conversion of this sort; and
 furthermore, they can always punish him on account of the
 temporal injuries which he has committed.

<h2>Question XXXII</h2>
<h3>Of One who is Convicted but who hath Fled or who Contumaciously Absents himself</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE Thirteenth and last method of arriving at a definite sentence
 in a process on behalf of the Faith is used when the person
 accused of heresy, after a diligent discussion of the merits of
 the process in consultation with learned lawyers, is found to be
 convicted of heresy, but has made his escape, or defiantly
 absents himself after the expiration of a set time. And this
 happens in three cases.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First, when the accused is convicted of heresy by his own
 confession, or by the evidence of the facts, or by the legitimate
 production of witnesses, but has fled, or has absented himself
 and refused to appear after being legally summoned.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, when a person has been accused and certain information
 has been laid against him on account of which he rests under some
 suspicion, even if it be only a light one, and he has been
 summoned to answer for his faith; and because he has defiantly
 refused to appear, he is excommunicated, and has stubbornly
 remained in that excommunication for a year, and always defiantly
 absents himself.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third case is when someone directly obstructs the Bishop's or
 Judge's sentence or process on behalf of the Faith, or lends his
 help, advice or protection for that purpose, and such a person
 has been stricken with the sword of excommunication. And if he
 was obstinately endured that excommunication for a year, he is
 then to be condemned as a heretic who has defied the
 administration of justice.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In the first case, such a person is, according to the Canon <i>ad
 abolendam</i>, to be condemned as an impenitent heretic. In the
 second and third cases he is not to be judged as an impenitent
 heretic, but to be condemned as if he were a penitent heretic.
 And in any of these cases the following procedure should be
 observed. When such a person has been awaited for sufficient
 time, let him be summoned by the Bishop and his officer in the
 Cathedral Church of that Diocese in which he has sinned, and in
 the other churches of that place where he had his dwelling, and
 especially from where he has fled; and let him be summoned in the
 following manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such Diocese, having in our
 charge the welfare of souls, and having above all the desires of
 our heart this most earnest desire that in our time in the said
 Diocese the Church should flourish and that there should be a
 fruitful and abundant harvest in that vineyard of the Lord of
 Hosts, which the right hand of the Most High Father has planted
 in the bosom of the righteous, which the Son of that Father has
 plentifully watered with His own life-giving Blood, which the
 reviving Spirit the Paraclete has made fruitful within by His
 wonderful and ineffable gifts, which the whole incomprehensible
 and ineffable Blessed Trinity has endowed and enriched with many
 very great and holy privileges; but the wild boar out of the
 forest, by which is meant any sort of heretic, has devoured and
 despoiled it, laying waste the fair fruit of the faith and
 planting thorny briars among the vines; and that tortuous
 serpent, the evil enemy of our human race, who is Satan and the
 devil, has breathed out venom and poisoned the fruit of the
 vineyard with the plague of heresy: And this is the field of the
 Lord, the Catholic Church, to till and cultivate which the only
 first-born Son of God the Father descended from the heights of
 Heaven, and sowed it with miracles and Holy discourse, going
 through towns and villages and teaching not without great labour;
 and He chose as His Apostles honest labouring men, and showed
 them the way, endowing them with eternal rewards; and the Son of
 God Himself expects to gather from that field on the Day of the
 Last Judgement a plentiful harvest, and by the hands of His Holy
 Angels to store it in His Holy barn in Heaven: But the foxes of
 Samson, two-faced like them who
 have fallen into the sin of heresy, having their faces looking
 both ways but tied together by their burning tails, run about
 with many torches amidst the fields of the Lord now white unto
 harvest and shining with the splendour of the faith, and bitterly
 despoil them, speeding most cunningly here and there, and with
 their strong attacks burning, dissipating, and decastation, and
 subtly and damnably subverting the truth of the Holy Catholic
 Faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore, since you, N., are fallen into the damned heresies of
 witches, practising them publicly in such place (naming it), and
 have been by legitimate witnesses convicted of the sin of heresy,
 or by your own confession received by us in Court; and after your
 capture you have escaped, refusing the medicine of your
 salvation: therefore we have summoned you to answer for the said
 crimes in person before us, but you, led away and seduced by a
 wicked spirit, have refused to appear.<p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
 Or as follows:
 </div><p>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore, since you, N., have been accused before us of the sin
 of heresy, and from information received against you we have
 judged that you are under a light suspicion of that sin, we have
 summoned you to appear personally before us to answer for the
 Catholic faith. And since, having been summoned, you have
 defiantly refused to appear, we excommunicated you and caused you
 to be proclaimed excommunicate. And in this state you have
 remained stubborn for a year, or so many years, hiding here and
 there, so that even now we do not know whither the evil spirit
 has led you; and though we have awaited you kindly and
 mercifully, that you might return to the bosom and the unity of
 the Holy Faith, you being wholly given up to evil have scorned to
 do so. Yet we wish and are bound to justice to conclude this case
 beyond any question, now can we pass over with connivent eyes
 your iniquitous crimes.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We the Bishop and Judges in the said cause on behalf of the faith
 require and strictly command by this our present public edict
 that you the aforesaid, at present in hiding and runaway and
 fugitive, shall on such a day of such a month in such a year, in
 such Cathedral Church of such Diocese, at the hour of Terce
 appear personally before us to hear your final sentence:
 signifying that, whether you appear or not, we shall proceed to
 our definitive sentence against you as law and justice shall
 require. And that our summons may come to your knowledge
 beforehand and you may not be able to protect yourself with a
 plea of ignorance, we wish and command that our said present
 letters, requisition and summons be publically affixed to the
 doors of the said Cathedral Church. In witness of all which we
 have ordered these our present letters to be authorized by the
 impressions of our seals. Given, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 On the appointed day assigned for the hearing of the final
 sentence, if the fugitive shall have appeared and consented to
 abjure publicly all heresy, humbly praying to be admitted to
 mercy, he is to be admitted if he has not been a backslider; and
 if he was convicted by his own confession or by the legitimate
 production of witnesses, he shall abjure and repent as a penitent
 heretic, according to the manner explained in the eighth method
 of concluding a process on behalf of the faith. If he was gravely
 suspected, and refused to appear when he was summoned to answer
 for his faith, and was therefore excommunicated and had endured
 that excommunication obstinately for a year, but becomes
 penitent, let him be admitted, and abjure all heresy, in the
 manner explained in the sixth method of pronouncing sentence. But
 if he shall appear, and not consent to abjure, let him be
 delivered as a truly impenitent heretic to the secular Court, as
 was explained in the tenth method. But if he still defiantly
 refuses to appear, let the sentence be pronounced in the
 following manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, seeing that you,
 N., of such a place in such a Diocese were accused before us by
 public report and the information of worthy men of the sin of
 heresy: We, whose duty it is, proceeded to examine and inquire
 whether there was any truth in the report which had come to our
 ears. And finding that you were convicted of heresy by the
 depositions of many credible witnesses, we commanded that you be
 brought before us in custody. (Here let it be said whether he had
 appeared and been questioned under oath or not.) But afterwards,
 led away and seduced by the advice of the evil spirit, and
 fearing to have your wounds wholesomely healed with wine and oil,
 you fled away (or, if it was the case, You broke from your prison
 and place of detention and fled away), hiding here and there, and
 we are altogether ignorant of whither the said evil spirit has
 led you.<p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
 Or after this manner:
 </div><p>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And finding that against you, accused as aforesaid before us of
 the sin of heresy, there were many indications by reason of which
 we judged you to be lightly suspected of the said heresy, we
 summoned you by public edict in such and such churches of such
 Diocese within a certain time assigned to appear in person before
 to answer to the said charges against you and otherwise on matter
 concerning the Faith. But you, following some mad advice,
 obstinately refused to appear. And when, as in justice bound, we
 excommunicated you and caused you to be publicly proclaimed
 excommunicate, you stubbornly remained in that excommunication
 for more than a year, and kept hidden here and there, so that we
 do not know whither the evil spirit has led you.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And where the Holy Church of God has long awaited you up to this
 present day in kindness and mercy, that you might fly to the
 bosom of her mercy, renouncing your errors and professing the
 Catholic Faith, and be nourished by the bounty of her mercy; but
 you have refused to consent, persisting in your obstinacy; and
 since we wished and still wish, as we ought to do and as justice
 compels us, to bring your case to an equitable conclusion, we
 have summoned you to appear in person before us on this day at
 this hour and place, to hear your final sentence. And since you
 have stubbornly refused to appear, you are manifestly proved to
 abide permanently in your errors and heresies; and this we say
 with grief, and grieve in saying it.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But since we cannot and will not delay to do justice, nor may we
 tolerate so great disobedience and defiance of the Church of God;
 for the exaltation of the Catholic Faith and the extirpation of
 vile heresy, at the call of justice, and by reason of your
 disobedience and obstinacy, on this day and at this hour and
 place heretofore strictly and precisely assigned to you for the
 hearing of your final sentence, having diligently and carefully
 discussed each several circumstance of the process with learned
 men in the Theological faculty and in the Canon and Civil Laws,
 sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, having before us the Holy
 Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from the countenance of
 God and our eyes see with equity, and having before our eyes only
 God and the irrefragable truth of the Holy Faith, and following
 in the footsteps of the Blessed Apostle Paul, in these writings
 we pronounce final sentence against you, N., absent or present,
 as follows, invoking the Name of Christ.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We the Bishop and Judges named on behalf of the Faith, whereas
 the process of this cause on behalf of the Faith has in all
 things been conducted as the laws require; and whereas you,
 having been legally summoned, have not appeared, and have not by
 yourself or any other person excused yourself; and whereas you
 have for a long time persisted and still obstinately persist in
 the said heresies, and have endured excommunication in the cause
 of the Faith for so many years, and still stubbornly endure it;
 and whereas the Holy Church of God can do no more for you, since
 you have persisted and intend to persist in your excommunication
 and said heresies: Therefore, following in the footsteps of the
 Blessed Apostle Paul, we declare, judge and sentence you, absent
 or present, to be a stubborn heretic, and as such to be abandoned
 to secular justice. And by this our definitive sentence we drive
 you from the ecclesiastical Court, and abandon you to the power
 of the secular Court; earnestly praying the said Court that, if
 ever it should have you in its power, it will moderate its
 sentence of death against you. This sentence was give, etc.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here it is to be considered that, if that stubborn fugitive had
 been convicted of heresy, either by his own confession or by
 credible witnesses, and had fled before his abjuration, he is by
 the sentence to be judged an impenitent heretic, and so it must
 be expressed in the sentence. But if, on the other hand, he had
 not been convicted, but had been summoned as one under suspicion
 to answer for his faith; and, because he has refused to appear,
 has been excommunicated, and has obstinately endured that
 excommunication for more than a year, and has finally refused to
 appear; then he is not to be judged a heretic, but as a heretic,
 and must be condemned as such; and so it must be expressed in the
 sentence,as it is said above.

<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Malleus Maleficarum Part 3</h1>
<h2>Question XXXIII</h2>
<h3>Of the Method of passing Sentence upon one who has been Accused by another Witch, who has been or is to be Burned at the Stake</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The fourteenth method of finally concluding a process on behalf
 of the Faith is used when the person accused of heresy, after a
 careful discussion of the circumstances of the process with
 reference to the informant in consultation with learned lawyers,
 is found to be accused of that heresy only by another witch who
 has been or is to be burned. And this can happen in thirteen ways
 in thirteen cases. For a person so accused is either found
 innocent and is to be freely discharged; or she is found to be
 generally defamed for that heresy; or it is found that, in
 addition to her defamation, she is to be to some degree exposed
 to torture; or she is found to be strongly suspected of heresy;
 or she is found to be at the same time defamed and suspected; and
 so on up to thirteen different cases, as was shown in the
 Twentieth Question. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The first case is when she is accused only by a witch in custody,
 and is not convicted either by her own confession or by
 legitimate witnesses, and there are no other indications found by
 reason of which she can truly be regarded as suspect.  In such a
 case she is to be entirely absolved, even by the secular Judge
 himself who has either burned the deponent or is about to burn
 her either on his own authority or on that commissioned to him by
 the Bishop and Judge of the Ordinary Court; and she shall be
 absolved in the manner explained in the Twentieth Question. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The second case is when, in addition to being accused by a witch
 in custody, she is also publicly defamed throughout the whole
 village or city; so that she has always laboured under that
 particular defamation, but, after the deposition of the witch, it
 has become aggravated. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In such a case the following should be the procedure. The Judge
 should consider that, apart from the general report, nothing
 particular has been proved against her by other credible
 witnesses in the village or town; and although, perhaps, that
 witch has deposed some serious charges against her, yet, since
 has lost her faith by denying it to the devil, Judges should give
 no ready credence to her words, unless there should be other
 circumstances which aggravate that report; and then the case
 would fall under the third and following case. Therefore she
 should be enjoined a canonical purgation, and the sentence should
 be pronounced as shown in the Twenty-first Question. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And if the civil Judge orders this purgation to the be made
 before the Bishop, and ends with a  solemn declaration that, if
 she should fail, then, as an example to others, she should be
 more severely sentenced by both the ecclesiastical and civil
 Judges, well and good. But if he wishes to conduct it himself,
 let him command her to find ten or twenty compurgators of her own
 class, and proceed in accordance with the second method of
 sentencing such: except that, if she has to be excommunicated,
 then he must have recourse to the Ordinary; and this would be the
 case if she refused to purge herself. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The third case, then, happens when the person so accused is not
 convicted by her own confession, not by the evidence of the
 facts, nor by credible witnesses, nor are there any other
 indications as to any fact in which she had ever been marked by
 the other inhabitants of that town or village, except her general
 reputation  among them. But the general report has become
 intensified by the detention  of that witch in custody, as that
 it is said that she had been her companion in everything and had
 participated in her crimes. But even so, the accused firmly
 denies all this, and nothing of it is known to other inhabitants,
 or of anything to save good behaviour on her part, though her
 companionship with the witch is admitted. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 In such a case the following is the procedure. First they are to
 be brought face to face, and their mutual answers and
 recriminations noted, to see whether there is any inconsistency
 in their words by reason of which the Judge can decide from her
 admissions and denials whether he ought to expose her to torture;
 and if so, he can proceed as in the third manner of pronouncing a
 sentence, explained in the Twenty-second Question, submitting her
 to light tortures: at the same time exercising every possible
 precaution, as we explained at length towards the beginning of
 this Third Part, to find out whether she is innocent or guilty.
 <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; The fourth case is when a person
 accused in this manner is found to be lightly suspected, either
 because of her own confession or because of the depositions of
 the other witch in custody. There are some who include among
 those who should be thus lightly suspected those who go and
 consult witches for any purpose, or have procured for themselves
 a lover by stirring up hatred between married folk, or have
 consorted with witches in order to obtain some temporal
 advantage. But such are to be excommunicated as followers of
 heretics, according to the Canon c. <i>excommunicamus</i>, where
 it says: Similarly we judge those to be heretics who believe in
 their errors. For the effect is presumed from the facts.
 Therefore it seems that such are to be more severely sentenced
 and punished than those who are under a light suspicion of heresy
 and are to be judged from light conjectures. For example, if they
 had performed services for witches or carried their letters to
 them, they need not on that account believe in their errors: yet
 they have not laid information against them, and they have
 received wages and vails from them. But whether or not such
 people are to be included in this case, according to the opinion
 of learned men the procedure must be as in the case of those
 under light suspicion, and the Judge will act as follows. Such a
 person will either abjure heresy or will purge herself
 canonically, as was explained in the fourth method of pronouncing
 sentence in the Twenty-third Question. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 However, it seems that the better course is for such a person to
 be ordered to abjure heresy, for this is more in accordance with
 the meaning of the Canon c. <i>excommunicamus</i>, where it
 speaks of those who are found to be only under some notable
 suspicion. And if such should relapse, they should not incur the
 penalty for backsliders. The procedure will be as above explained
 in the fourth method of sentencing. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The fifth case is when such person is found to be under a strong
 suspicion, by reason, as before, of her own confession or of the
 depositions of the other witch in custody. In this class some
 include those who directly or indirectly obstruct the Court in
 the process of trying a witch, provided that they do this
 wittingly. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Also they include all who give help, advice or protection to
 those who cause such obstructions. Also those who instruct
 summoned or captured heretics to conceal the truth or in some way
 falsify it. Also all those who wittingly receive, or visit those
 whom they know to be heretics, or associate with them, send them
 gifts, or show favour to them; for all such actions, when done
 with full knowledge, bespeak favour felt towards the sin, and not
 to the person. And therefore they say that, when the accused is
 guilty of any of the above actions, and has been proved so after
 trial, then she should be sentenced in the fifth method,
 explained in the Twenty-fourth Question; so that she must abjure
 all heresy, under pain of being punished as a backslider. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 As to these contentions we may say that the Judge must take into
 consideration the household and family of each several witch who
 has been burned or is detained; for these are generally found to
 be infected. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For witches are instructed by devils to offer to them even their
 own children; therefore there can be no doubt that such children
 are instructed in all manner of crimes, as is shown in the First
 Part of this work. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, in a case of simple heresy it happens that, on account of
 the familiarity between heretics who are akin to each other, when
 one is convicted of heresy it follows that his kindred also are
 strongly suspected; and the same is true of the heresy of
 witches. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But this present case is made clear in the chapter of the Canon
 <i>inter sollicitudines</i>. For a certain Dean was, owing to his
 reputation as a heretic, enjoined a canonical purgation; on
 account of his familiarity with heretics, he had to make a public
 abjuration; and through the scandal he was deprived of his
 benefice, so that the scandal might be allayed. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The sixth case is when such a person is under a grave suspicion;
 but no simple and bare deposition by another witch in custody can
 cause this, for there must be in addition some indication of the
 facts, derived from certain words or deeds uttered or committed
 by the witch in custody, in which the accused is at least said to
 have taken some part, and shared in the evil deeds of the
 deponent. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To understand this, the reader should refer to what was written
 in the Nineteenth Question, especially concerning the grave
 degree of suspicion, how it arise from grave and convincing
 conjectures; and how the Judge is forced to believe, on mere
 suspicion, that a person is a heretic, although perhaps in his
 heart he is a true Catholic. The Canonists give an example of
 this by the case, in simple heresy, of a man summoned to answer
 in the cause of the faith, and defiantly refusing to appear, on
 which account he is excommunicated, and if he persists in that
 state for a year, becomes gravely suspected of heresy. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And so likewise in the case of person accused in the way we are
 considering, the indications of the facts are to be examined by
 which she is rendered gravely suspect. Let us put the case that
 the witch in custody has asserted that the accused has taken part
 in her evil works of witchcraft, but the accused firmly denies
 it. What then is to be done? It will be necessary to consider
 whether there are any facts to engender a strong suspicion of
 her, and whether that strong suspicion can become a grave one.
 Thus, if a man has been summoned to answer some charge, and has
 obstinately refused to appear, he would come under a light
 suspicion of heresy, even if he had not been summoned in a cause
 concerning the Faith. But if he then refused to appear in a cause
 concerning the Faith and was excommunicated for his obstinacy,
 then he would be strongly suspected; for the light suspicion
 would become a strong one; and if then he remained obstinate in
 excommunication for a year, the strong suspicion would become a
 grave one. Therefore the Judge will consider whether, by reason
 of her familiarity with the witch in custody, the accused is
 under a strong suspicion, in the manner shown in the fifth case
 above; and then he must consider whether there is anything which
 may turn that strong suspicion into a grave one. For it is
 presumed that it is possible for this to be the case, on account
 of the accused having perhaps shared in the crimes of the
 detained witch, if she has had frequent intercourse with her.
 Therefore the Judge must proceed as in the sixth method of
 sentencing explained in the Twenty-fifth Question. But it may be
 asked what the Judge is to do if the person so accused by a witch
 in custody still altogether persists in her denials, in spite of
 all indications against her. We answer as follows: <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 First the Judge must consider whether those denials do or do not
 proceed from the vice or witchcraft of taciturnity: and, as was
 shown in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Questions of this Third
 part, the Judge can know this from her ability or inability  to
 shed tears, or from her insensibility under torture and quick
 recovery of her strength afterwards. For then the grave suspicion
 would be aggravated; and in such a case she is by no means to be
 freely discharged, but, according to the sixth method of
 sentencing, she must be condemned to perpetual imprisonment and
 penance. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if she is not infected with the taciturnity of witches, but
 feels the keenest pains in her torture (whereas others, as has
 been said, become insensible to pain owing to the witchcraft of
 taciturnity), then the Judge must fall back upon his last
 expedient of a canonical purgation. And if this should be ordered
 by a secular Judge, it is called a lawful vulgar purgation, since
 it cannot be classed with other vulgar purgations. And if she
 should fail in this purgation she will be judged guilty. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The seventh case is when the accused is not found guilty by his
 own confession, by the evidence of the facts, or by legitimate
 witnesses, but is only found to be accused by a witch in custody,
 and there are also some indications found which bring him under
 light or strong suspicion. As, for example, that he had had great
 familiarity with witches; in which case he would, according to
 the Canon, have to undergo a canonical purgation on account of
 the general report concerning him; and on account of the
 suspicion against him he must abjure heresy, under pain of being
 punished as a backslider if it was a strong suspicion, but not if
 it was a light one. <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The eighth case occurs when the person so accused is found to
 have confessed that heresy, but to be penitent, and never to have
 relapsed. But here it is to be noted that in this and the other
 cases, where it is a question of those who have or have not
 relapsed, and who are or are not penitent, these distinctions are
 made only for the benefit of Judges who are not concerned with
 the infliction of the extreme penalty. Therefore the civil Judge
 may proceed in accordance with the Civil and Imperial Laws, as
 justice shall demand, in the case of one who has confessed, no
 matter whether or not she be penitent, or whether or not she have
 relapsed. Only he may have recourse to those thirteen methods of
 pronouncing sentence, and act in accordance with them, if any
 doubtful question should arise. <hr/>

<h2>Question XXXIV</h2>
<h3>Of the Method of passing Sentence upon a Witch who Annuls Spells wrought by Witchcraft; and of Witch Midwives and Archer-Wizards</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 THE fifteenth method of bringing a process on behalf of the faith
 to a definitive sentence is employed when the person accused of
 heresy is not found to be one who casts injurious spells of
 witchcraft, but one who removes them; and in such a case the
 procedure will be as follows. The remedies which she uses will
 either be lawful or unlawful; and if they are lawful, she is not
 to be judged a witch but a good Christian. But we have already
 shown at length what sort of remedies are lawful.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Unlawful remedies, on the other hand, are to be distinguished as
 either absolutely unlawful, or in some respect unlawful. If they
 are absolutely unlawful, these again can be divided into two
 classes, according as they do or do not involve some injury to
 another party; but in either case they are always accompanied by
 an expressed invocation of devils. But if they are only in some
 respect unlawful, that is to say, if they are practised with only
 a tacit, and not an expressed, invocation of devils, such are to
 be judged rather vain than unlawful, according to the Canonists
 and some Theologians, as we have already shown.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Therefore the Judge, whether ecclesiastical or civil, must not
 punish the first and last of the above practices, having rather
 to commend the first and tolerate the last, since the Canonists
 maintain that it is lawful to oppose vanity with vanity. But he
 must by no means tolerate those who remove spells by an expressed
 invocation of devils, especially those who in doing so bring some
 injury upon a third part; and this last is said to happen when
 the spell is taken off one person and transferred to another. And
 we have already made it clear in a former part of this work that
 it makes no difference whether the person to whom the spell is
 transferred be herself a witch or not or whether or not she be
 the person who cast the original spell, or whether it be a man or
 any other creature.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It may be asked what the Judge should do when such a person
 maintains that she removes spells by lawful and not unlawful
 means; and how the Judge can arrive at the truth of such a case.
 We answer that he should summon her and ask her what remedies she
 uses; but he must not rely only upon her word, for the
 ecclesiastical Judge whose duty it is must make diligent inquiry,
 either himself or by means of some parish priest who shall
 examine all his parishioners after placing them upon oath, as to
 what remedies she uses. And if, as is usually the case, they are
 found to be superstitious remedies, they must in no way be
 tolerated, on account of the terrible penalties laid down by the
 Canon Law, as will be shown.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Again, it may be asked how the lawful remedies can be
 distinguished from the unlawful, since they always assert that
 they remove spells by certain prayers and the use of herbs. We
 answer that this will be easy, provided that a diligent inquiry
 be made. For although they must necessarily conceal their
 superstitious remedies, either that they may not be arrested, or
 that they may the more easily ensnare the minds of the simple,
 and therefore make great show of their use of prayers and herbs,
 yet they can be manifestly convicted by four superstitious
 actions as sorceresses and witches.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For there are some who can divine secrets, and are able to tell
 things which they could only know through the revelation of evil
 spirits. For example: when the injured come to them to be healed,
 they can discover and make known the cause of their injury; and
 they can perfectly know this and tell it to those who consult
 them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, they sometimes undertake to cure the injury or spell of
 one person, but will have nothing to do with that of another. For
 in the Diocese of Spires there is a witch in a certain place
 called Zunhofen who, although she seems to heal many persons,
 confesses that she can in no way heal certain others; and this is
 for no other reason than, as the inhabitants of the place assert,
 that the spells case on such person have been so potently wrought
 by other witches with the help of devils that the devils
 themselves cannot remove them. For one devil cannot or will not
 always yield to another.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, it sometimes happens that they must make some
 reservation or exception in their cure of such injuries. Such a
 case is known to have occured in the town of Spires itself. And
 honest woman who had been bewitched in her shins sent for a
 diviner of this sort to come and heal her; and when the witch had
 entered her house and looked at her, she made such an exception.
 For she said: It there are no scales and hairs in the wound, I
 could take out all the other evil matter. And she revealed the
 cause of the injury, although she had come from the country from
 a distance of two miles, saying: You quarrelled with your
 neighbour on such a day, and therefore this had happened to you.
 Then, having extracted from the wound many other matters of
 various sorts, which were not scales or hairs, she restored her
 to health.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fourthly, they sometimes themselves observe, or cause to be
 observed, certain superstitious ceremonies. For instance, they
 fix some such time as before sunrise for people to visit them; or
 say that they cannot heal injuries which were caused beyond the
 limits of the estate on which they live, or that they can only
 heal two or three persons in a year. Yet they do not heal them,
 but only seem to do so by creasing to injure them.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 We could add many other considerations as touching the condition
 of such persons: as that, after the lapse of a certain time they
 have incurred the reputation of leading a bad and sinful life, or
 that they are adulteresses, or the survivors from covens of other
 witches. Therefore their gift of healing is not derived from God
 on account of the sanctity of their lives.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here we must refer incidentally to witch midwives, who surpass
 all other witches in their crimes, as we have shown in the First
 Part of this work. And the number of them is so great that, as
 has been found form their confessions, it is thought they there
 is scarcely any tiny hamlet in which at least one is not to be
 found. And that the magistrates may in some degree meet this
 danger, they should allow no midwife to practise without having
 been first sworn as a good Catholic; at the same time observing
 the other safeguards mentioned in the Second Part of this
 work.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Here too we must consider archer-wizards, who constitute the
 graver danger to the Christian religion in that they have
 obtained protection on the estates of nobles and Princes who
 receive, patronize, and defend them. But that all such receivers
 and protectors are more damnable than all witches, especially in
 certain cases, is shown as follows. The Canonists and Theologians
 divide into two classes the patrons of such archer-wizards,
 according as they defend the error or the person. They who defend
 the error are more damnable than the wizards themselves, since
 they are judged to be not only heretics but heresiarchs (24,
 quest. 3). And the laws do not make much special mention of such
 patrons, because they do not distinguish them from other
 heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there are others who, while not excusing the sin, yet defend
 the sinner. These, for example, will do all in their power to
 protect such wizards (or other heretics) from trial and
 punishment at the hands of the Judge acting on behalf of the
 Faith.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Similarly there are those in public authority, that is to say,
 public persons such as temporal Lords, and also spiritual Lords
 who have temporal jurisdiction, who are, either by omission or
 commission, patrons of such wizards and heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 They are their patrons by omission when they neglect to perform
 their duty in regard to such wizards and suspects, or to their
 followers, receivers, defenders and patrons, when they are
 required by the Bishops or Inquisitors to do this: that is, by
 falling to arrest them, by not guarding them carefully when they
 are arrested, by not taking them to the place within their
 jurisdiction which has been appointed for them, by not promptly
 executing the sentence passed upon them, and by other such
 derelictions of their duty.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 They are their patrons by commission when, after such heretics
 have been arrested, they liberate them from prison without the
 licence or order of the Bishop or Judge; or when they directly or
 indirectly obstruct the trial, judgement, and sentence of such,
 or act in some similar way. The penalties for this have been
 declared in the Second Part of this work, where we treated of
 archer-wizards and other enchanters of weapons.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 It is enough now to say that all these are by law excommunicated,
 and incur the twelve great penalties. And if they continues
 obstinate in that excommunication for a year, they are then to be
 condemned as heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Who, then, are to be called receivers of such; and are they to be
 reckoned as heretics? All they, we answer, who receive such
 archer-wizards, enchanters of weapons, necromancers, or heretic
 witches as are the subject of this whole work. And such receivers
 are of two classes, as was the case with the defenders and
 patrons of such.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 For there are some who do not receive them only once or twice,
 but many times and often; and these are well called in Latin
 <i>receptatores</i>, from the frequentative form of the verb. And
 receivers of this class are sometimes blameless, since they act
 in ignorance and there is no sinister suspicion attaching to
 them. But sometimes they are to blame, as being well aware of the
 sins of those whom they receive; for the Church always denounces
 these wizards as the most cruel enemies of the faith. And if
 nevertheless temporal Lords receive, keep and defend them, etc.,
 they are and are rightly called receivers of heretics. And with
 regard to such, the laws say that they are to be
 excommunicated.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But others there are who do not often or many times receive such
 wizards or heretics, but only once or twice; and these are not
 properly called <i>receptatores</i>, but <i>receptores</i>, since
 they are not frequent receivers. (Yet the Arch-deacon disagrees
 with this view; but it is no great matter, for we are considering
 not words but deeds.)<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But there is this difference between <i>receptatores</i> and
 <i>receptores</i>: those temporal Princes are always
 <i>receptatores</i> who simply will not or cannot drive away such
 heretics. But <i>receptores</i> may be quite innocent.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Finally, it is asked who are they who are said to be obstructors
 of the duty of Inquisitors and Bishops against such heretics; and
 whether they are to be reckoned as heretics. We answer that such
 obstructors are of two kinds. For there are some who cause a
 direct obstruction, by rashly on their own responsibility
 releasing from gaol those who have been detained on a charge of
 heresy, or by interfering with the process of the Inquisition by
 wreaking some injury to witnesses on behalf of the Faith because
 of the evidence they have given; or it may be that the temporal
 Lord issues an order that none but himself may try such a case,
 and that anyone charged with this crime should be brought before
 no one but himself, and that the evidence should be given only in
 his presence, or some similar order. And such, according to
 Giovanni d'Andrea, are direct obstructors. They who directly
 obstruct the process, judgement or sentence on behalf of the
 Faith, or help, advise or favour others in doing so, although
 they are guilty of a great sin, are not on that account to be
 judged heretics, unless it appears in other ways that they are
 obstinately and wilfully involved in such heresies of witches.
 But they are to be smitten with the sword of excommunication; and
 if they stubbornly endure that excommunication for a year, then
 are they to be condemned as heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But others are indirect obstructors. These, as Giovanni d'Andrea
 explains, are those who give such orders as that no one shall
 bear arms for the capture of heretics except the servants of the
 said temporal Lord. Such are less guilty than the former, and are
 not heretics; but they, and also any who advise, help or
 patronize them in such actions, are to be excommunicated; and if
 they obstinately remain in that excommunication for a year, they
 are then to be condemned as if they were heretics. And here it is
 to be understood that they are in such a way to be condemned as
 heretics that if they are willing to return, they are received
 back to mercy, having first abjured their error; but if not, they
 are to be handed over to the secular Court as impenitents.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To sum up. Witch-midwives, like other witches, are to be
 condemned and sentences according to the nature of their crimes;
 and this is true also of those who, as we have said, remove
 spells of witchcraft superstitiously and by the help of devils;
 for it can hardly be doubted that, just as they are able to
 remove them, so can they inflict them. And it is a fact  that
 some definite agreement is formed between witches and devils
 whereby some shall be able to hurt and others to heal, that so
 they may more easily ensnare the minds of the simple and recruit
 the ranks of their abandoned and hateful society. Archer-wizards
 and enchanters of weapons, who are only protected by being
 patronized, defended and received by temporal Lords, are subject
 to the same penalties; and they who patronize them, etc., or
 obstruct the officers of justice in their proceedings against
 them, are subject to all the penalties to which the patrons of
 heretics are liable, and are to be excommunicated. And if after
 they have obstinately endured that excommunication for a year
 they wish to repent, let them abjure that obstruction and
 patronage, and if not, they must be handed over as impenitents to
 the secular Court. And even if they have not endured their
 excommunication for a year, such obstructors can still be
 proceeded against as patrons of heretics.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And all that has been said with regard to patrons, defenders,
 receivers, and obstructors in the case of archer-wizards, etc.,
 applies equally in respect of all other witches who work various
 injuries to men, animals, and the fruits of the earth. But even
 the witches themselves, when in the court of conscience with
 humble and contrite spirit they weep for their sins and make
 clean confession asking forgiveness, are taken back to mercy. But
 when they are known, those whose duty it is must proceed against
 them, summoning, examining, and detaining them, and in all things
 proceeding in accordance with the nature of their crimes to a
 definitive and conclusive sentence, as has been shown, if they
 wish to avoid the snare of eternal damnation by reason of the
 excommunication pronounced upon them by the Church when they
 deliberately fail in their duty.

<h2>Question XXXV</h2>
<h3>Finally, of the Method of passing Sentence upon Witches who Enter or Cause to be Entered an Appeal, whether such be Frivolous or Legitimate and Just</h3></div>


  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if the Judge perceives that the accused is determined to have
 recourse to an appeal, he must first take note that such appeals
 are sometimes valid and legitimate, and sometimes entirely
 frivolous. Now it has already been explained that cases
 concerning the Faith are to be conducted in a simple and summary
 fashion, and therefore that no appeal is admitted in such cases.
 Nevertheless it sometimes happens that Judges, on account of the
 difficulty of the case, gladly prorogue and delay it; therefore
 they may consider that it would be just to allow an appeal when
 the accused feels that the Judge has really and actually acted
 towards him in a manner contrary to the law and justice; as that
 he has refused to allow him to defend himself, or that he has
 proceeded to a sentence against the accused on his own
 responsibility and without the counsel of others, or even without
 consent of the Bishop or his Vicar, when he might have taken into
 consideration much further evidence both for and against. For
 such reasons an appeal may be allowed, but not otherwise.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Secondly, it is to be noted that, when notice of appeal has been
 given, the Judge should, without perturbation or disturbance, ask
 for a copy of the appeal, giving his promise that the matter
 shall not be delayed. And when the accused has given him a copy
 of the appeal, the Judge shall notify him that he has yet two
 days before he need answer it, and after those two days thirty
 more before he need prepare the apostils of the case. And
 although he may give his answer at once, and at once proceed to
 issue his apostils if he is very expert and experienced, yet it
 is better to act with caution, and fix a term of ten or twenty or
 twenty-five days, reserving to himself the right to prorogue the
 hearing of the appeal up to the legal limit of time.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Thirdly, let the Judge take care that during the legal and
 appointed interval he must diligently examine and discuss the
 causes of the appeal and the alleged grounds of objection. And if
 after having taken good counsel he sees that he has unduly and
 unjustly proceeded against the accused, by refusing him
 permission to defend himself, or by exposing him to questions at
 an unsuitable time, or for any such reason; when the appointed
 time comes let him correct his mistake, carrying the process back
 to the point and stage where it was when the accused asked to be
 defended, or when he put a term to his examination, etc., and so
 remove the objection; and then let him proceed as we have said.
 For by the removal of the grounds for objection the appeal, which
 was legitimate, loses its weight.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But here the circumspect and provident Judge will carefully take
 note that some grounds of objection or reparable; and they are
 such as we have just spoken of, and are to be dealt with in the
 above manner. But others are irreparable: as when the accused has
 actually and in fact been questioned, but has afterwards escaped
 and lodged an appeal; or that some box or vessel or such
 instruments as witches use has been seized and burned; or some
 other such irreparable and irrevocable action has been committed.
 In such a case the above procedure would not hold good, namely,
 taking the process back to the point where the objection
 arose.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fourthly, the Judge must note that, although thirty days may
 elapse between his receiving the appeal and his completing the
 apostils of the case, and he can assign to the petitioner the
 last day, that is, the thirtieth, for the hearing of his appeal;
 yet, that it may not seem that the wishes to molest the accused
 or some under suspicion of unduly harsh treatment of him, and
 that his behaviour may not seem to lend support to the objection
 which has caused the appeal, it is better that he should assign
 some day within the legal limit, such as the tenth or twentieth
 day, and he can afterwards, if he does not wish to be in a hurry,
 postpone it until the last legal day, saying that he is busy with
 other affairs.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Fifthly, the Judge must take care that, when he affixes a term
 for the accused who is appealing and petitioning for apostils, he
 must provide not only for the giving, but both for the giving and
 receiving of apostils. For if he provided only for the giving of
 them, then the Judge against whom the appeal is lodged would have
 to discharge the appellant. Therefore let him assign to him a
 term, that is, such a day of such a year, for the giving and
 receiving from the Judge such apostils as he shall have decided
 to submit.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Sixthly, he must take care that, in assigning this term, he shall
 not in his answer say that he will give either negative or
 affirmative apostils; but that he may have opportunity for fuller
 reflection, let him say that he will give such as he shall at the
 appointed time have decided upon.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let him also take care that in assigning this term to the
 appellant he give the appellant no opportunity to exercise any
 malicious precautions or cunning, and that he specify the place,
 day and hour. For example, let him assign the twentieth day of
 August, in the present year, at the hour of vespers, and the
 chamber of the Judge himself in such a house, in such a city, for
 the giving and receiving of apostils such as shall have been
 decided upon for such appellant.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Seventhly, let him note that, if he has decided in his mind that
 the charge against the accused justly requires that he should be
 detained, in assigning the term he must set it down that he
 assigns that term for the giving or receiving of apostils by the
 appellant in person, and that he assigns to the said appellant
 such a place for giving to him and receiving from him apostils;
 and then it will be fully in the power of the Judge to detain the
 appellant, granted that he has first given negative apostils; but
 otherwise it will not be so.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Eighthly, let the Judge take care not to take any further action
 in respect of the appellant, such as arresting him, or
 questioning him, or liberating him from prison, from the time
 when the appeal is presented to  him up to the time when he has
 returned negative apostils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 To sum up. Note that it often happens that, when the accused is
 in doubt as to what sort of sentence he will receive, since he is
 conscious of his guilt, he frequently takes refuge in an appeal,
 that so he may escape the Judge's sentence. Therefore he appeals
 from that Judge, advancing some frivolous reason, as that the
 Judge held him in custody without allowing him the customary
 surety; or in some such way he may colour his frivolous appeal.
 In this case the Judge shall ask for a copy of the appeal; and
 having received it he shall either at once or after two days give
 his answer and assign to the appellant for the giving and
 receiving of such apostils as shall have been decided upon a
 certain day, hour, and place, within the legal limit, as, for
 instance, the 25th, 26th or 30th day of such a month. And during
 the assigned interval the Judge shall diligently examine the copy
 of the appeal, and the reasons or objections upon which it is
 based, and shall consult with learned lawyers whether he shall
 submit negative apostils, that is, negative answers, and thereby
 disallow the appeal, or whether he shall allow the appeal and
 submit affirmative and fitting apostils to the Judge to whom the
 appeal is made.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he sees that the reasons for the appeal are frivolous and
 worthless, and that the appellant only wishes to escape or to
 postpone his sentence, let his apostils be negative and
 refutatory. If, however, he sees that the objections are true and
 just, and not irreparable; or if he is in doubt whether the
 accused is maliciously causing him trouble, and wishes to clear
 himself of all suspicion, let him grant the appellant affirmative
 and fitting apostils. And when the appointed time for the
 appellant has arrived, if the Judge has not prepared his apostils
 or answers, or in some other way is not ready, the appellant can
 at once demand that his appeal be heard, and may continue to do
 so on each successive day up to the thirtieth, which is the last
 day legally allowed for the submission of the apostils.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if he has prepared them and is ready, he can at once give his
 apostils to the appellant. If, then, he has decided to give
 negative or refutatory apostils, he shall, at the expiration of
 the appointed time, submit them in the following manner:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 AND the said Judge, answering to the said appeal, if it may be
 called an appeal, says that he, the Judge, has proceeded and did
 intend to proceed in accordance with the Canonical decrees and
 the Imperial statutes and laws, and has not departed from the
 path of either law nor intended so to depart, and has in no way
 acted or intended to act unjustly towards the appellant, as is
 manifest from an examination of the alleged grounds for this
 appeal. For he has not acted unjustly towards him by detaining
 him and keeping him in custody; for he was accused of such
 heresy, and there was such evidence against him that he was
 worthily convicted of heresy, or was strongly suspected, and as
 such it was and is just that he should be kept in custody:
 neither has he acted unjustly by refusing him sureties; for the
 crime of heresy is one of the more serious crimes, and the
 appellant had been convicted but persisted in denying the charge,
 and therefore not even the very best sureties were admissable,
 but he is and was to be detained in prison. And so he shall
 proceed with the other objections.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Having done this, let him say as follows: Wherefore it is
 apparant that the Judge has duly and justly proceeded, and has
 not deviated from the path of justice, and has in no way unduly
 molested the appellant; but the appellant, advancing pretended
 and false objections, has by an undue and unjust appeal attempted
 to escape his sentence. Wherefore his appeal is frivolous and
 worthless, having no foundation, and erring in matter and form.
 And since the laws do not recognize frivolous appeals, nor are
 they to be recognized by the Judge, therefore the Judge has
 himself said that he does not admit and does not intend to admit
 the said appeal, nor does he recognize nor yet propose to
 recognize it. And he gives this answer to the said accused who
 make this undue appeal in the form of negative apostils, and
 commands that they be given to him immediately after the said
 appeal. And so he shall give it to the Notary who has presented
 the appeal to him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 And when these negative apostils have been given to the
 appellant, the Judge shall at once proceed with his duty,
 ordering the accused to be seized and detained, or assigning to
 him a day to appear before him, as shall seem best to him. For he
 does not cease to be the Judge, but shall continue his process
 against the appellant until the Judge to whom the appeal was made
 shall order him to cease.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But let the Judge take care not to commence any new proceedings
 against the appellant, by arresting him or, if he is in custody,
 liberating him from prison, from the time of the presentation of
 the appeal up to the time of the return of negative apostils to
 him. But after that time, as we have said, he can do so if
 justice requires it, until he is prevented by the Judge to whom
 the appeal has been made. Then, with the process sealed under
 cover, and with a sure and safe escort and if necessary a
 suitable surety, let him send him to the said Judge.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if the Judge has decided to return affirmative and fitting
 apostils, let him submit them in writing in the following manner
 on the arrival of the day appointed for the giving and receiving
 of apostils:<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 AND the said Judge, answering to the said appeal, if it may be
 called an appeal, if it may be called an appeal, says that he has
 proceeded in the present cause justly and as he ought and not
 otherwise, nor has he molested or intended to molest the
 appellant, as is apparent from a perusal of the alleged
 objections. For he has not molested him by, etc. (Here he shall
 answer to each of the objections in the appeal, in the best and
 most truthful manner that he can.) <br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Wherefore it is apparent that the said Judge has in no way dealt
 unjustly by the appellant nor given him cause to appeal, but that
 the appellant is afraid lest justice should proceed against him
 according to his crimes. And therefore the appeal is frivolous
 and worthless, having no foundation, and not being admissable by
 the laws or the Judge. But in reverence for the Apostolic See, to
 which the appeal is made, the said Judge says that he admits the
 appeal an intends to recognize it, deferring the whole matter to
 out Most Holy Lord the Pope, and leaving it to the Holy Apostolic
 See: assigning to the said appellant a certain time, namely, so
 many months now following, within which, with the process sealed
 under cover given to him by the said Judge, or having given
 suitable sureties to present himself at the Court of Rome, or
 under a sure and safe escort appointed to him by the said Judge,
 he must present himself in the Court of Rome before our Lord the
 Pope. And this answer the said Judge gives tot he said appellant
 as affirmative apostils, and orders that it be given to him
 immediately after the appeal presented to him. And so he shall
 hand it to the Notary who has presented the appeal to him.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 The prudent Judge must here take note that, as soon as he has
 given these fitting apostils to the appellant, he at once ceases
 to be the Judge in that cause from which the appeal was made, and
 can proceed no further in it, unless it be referred back to him
 by our Most Holy Lord the Pope. Therefore let him have no more to
 do with that case, except to send the said appellant in the above
 manner to out Lord the Pope, assign to him a convenient time, say
 one, two or three months, within which he must prepare and make
 himself ready to appear and present himself at the Court of Rome,
 giving a suitable surety; or, if he cannot do this, let him be
 sent under a sure and safe escort. For he must either bind
 himself by the best means in his power to present himself within
 the assigned time before our Lord the Pope in the Court of Rome,
 or his appeal must necessarily fall to the ground.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 But if the Judge has another case, and proceeds against the
 accused in another case in which he has not lodged any appeal: in
 that other case he remains, as before, Judge. And even if, after
 the appeal has been admitted, and the affirmative apostils have
 been given, the appellant is accused and denounced to the Judge
 in respect of other heresies which were not in question in the
 case from which he appealed, he does not cease to be the Judge,
 and can proceed with the inquiry and the examination of witnesses
 as before. And when the first case has been finished in the Court
 of Rome, or after reference back to the Judge, he is free to
 proceed with the second.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let Judges also take care that they send the process to the Court
 of Rome, sealed and under cover, to the Judges appointed to
 execute justice, together with a digest of the merits of the
 process. And Inquisitors should not concern themselves to appear
 at Rome against the appellants; but should leave them to their
 own Judges, who, if the Inquisitors are unwilling to appear
 against the appellants, shall provide their own advocates for the
 appellant, if they wish to expedite the case.<br/>

  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;
 Let Judges also take note that, if they are personally summoned
 by the appellant, and appear, they must beware at all costs
 against engaging in litigation, but must leave the whole process
 and cause to those Judges, and so manage that they may be able to
 return as soon as possible; so that they may not be sorely
 troubled with fatigues, misery, labour, and expense in Rome. For
 by this means much damage is caused to the Church, and heretics
 are greatly encouraged; and thereafter Judges will not receive so
 much respect and reverence, not will they be so much feared as
 before. Also other heretics, seeing the Judges fatigued and
 detained in the Court of Rome, will exalt their horns, and
 despise and malign them, and more boldly proclaim their heresies;
 and when they are accused, they will appeal in the same way.
 Other Judges, also, will have their authority weakened when they
 proceed on behalf of the Faith and are zealous in extirpating
 heretics, since they will fear lest they may be troubled with
 miseries and fatigues arising from similar appeals. All this is
 most prejudicial to the Faith of the Holy Church of God;
 wherefore may the Spouse of that Church in mercy preserve her
 from all such injuries.
